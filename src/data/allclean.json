Meeting up with Michel and D. and getting drunk.","The day after, Claire's plane left her stranded in Amsterdam, so after much messing around she stayed with the ever mighty Karl. Next week looks like more juggling, sorting and one Vodafone party and one leaving do - mine.","Karl visiting at the weekend and my mum is over on Sunday. I leave for France a week on Tuesday or is it Wednesday, only to meet Claire the next day and then we calm down in the pool before we kiss goodbye to Europe and start the trip. Where?","Karl just opened another beer, is it a Duvel?"],

You see, we live in different countries and that is shit. The contract was gonna be a step to start in another city. It was half arsed attempt to do this, the bullshit involved is huge and I reckon would take at least a year to clear up.",
        "So it was a crap new year and general crap time and it was against my idea, that this year should be easy. Last year was fucking great and so hectic. So we decided to travel. Pack our jobs in and get gone. No more bills, no more routine, no more job, no more house! Step off and let all that stuff come back in a years time. Initially we thought we could do this after we settled in a city for a year, this would make a great deal of sense financially, but also could mean that we wouldn't travel. It soon came clear it was now or never and even worse that that, we should have done it years ago!",
        "I've got some friends that are gonna be in Bolivia in August, so this is our starting spot. So South America and then on to New Zealand, Thailand and then on to India, before returning back to Europe. First its jabs, visas and all that stuff and a better plan. We went to  and found a few things out. Like you can  only fly to New Zealand from Santiago (in Chile).",
        "We looking at spending around GBP 1,900 on a round the world ticket and spending GBP 25 a day. So roughly, we got to get together GBP 10,000 and we are away. With our savings, we could do this by the summer (northern hemisphere). The timings of when to visit places is awkward also, it will be winter in Bolivia when we get there and snowy in Chile. Also it might be rainy season when we get to Thailand. There was a flood in Indonesia a couple of weeks ago displacing 100's of thousands of people, as this  can tell you. So there's a lot of planning to do. Also the Philippines looks good and Sri Lanka has this huge monument that has a wonderful view. You can dive with Sharks in the Maldives. Lots of options, too many. It should be great, thats if we don't fall out, get really sick, get robbed, go insaine. No fuck all that, its gonna be great"],

All rubbish out the window.","So where's the taxi? There's a moterbike though. We walk across the dust road and get on the back seat, (which is a double seat) and we chug down the bumpy road to the paradise. We are meet by the swiz/italian couple who run the place. She offers us a sandwich, we take a beer. After which, we take a quick walk through the botanical gardens into our hut and crash.","The next couple of days we are kicking dead crabs over on the beach, getting twisted on cheap rum, watching the pterodactyls (frigates) and turkey vaulters in the sky. We swim in the pacific ocean, we get on a boat and see... blue footed boobies, albatrosses, whales (!), a whole load of fish underwater.","Tomorrow we get on another bus for a monster trip to Cuenca, but first here's a load of pictures..."],

I reckon that croc could have taken the whole place down. Saw Piranhas (most are veggie) and nasty snakes though.","On to Loja (J pronounced H) and then on to the small town of Vilcabamba. We find a place for a night, before heading up the hill to stay in a great hostel with a really wonderful panoramic view of the Andes.","My birthday we go into the cloud forest with a great Finnish couple. We get a bus out to the national park, get out and walked along the edge of the light gray mud road. Trees steeply went up at either side, I joked that the guide would tell us we had to just start climbing into the forest from here. Then he did.","Proper adventure into thick forest, although it was a route he did every day and he had a machete which at some stages he cleared the path a bit. It was a good route though, over rocks, under fallen trees and bits where the forest opened up to wonderful rolling views of trees covered in slow moving clouds. It was all good, tall trees with vines like rope and tick roots that help the tree shift direction, also huge ferns, well everything was exaggerated.","No animals though, although we did see puma tracks, not many birds either and no bugs apart from one scarab beetle, but well worth doing, although I write this on the 23rd and yes I still ache. See if you can spot the hummingbird nest in the pictures below.","That night we decided to got into town for booze and to celebrate my 36th year. This is where the weirdness begins. We find the most interesting looking bar that looks over the square where the local populaces drink shorts.","It didn't take long until the people on the next table (English, Irish and American) start talking to us. One bloke is from Belper. He's 32 and his favorite band growing up was Pitchshifter. He brought it up, its all too weird..... How far do you have to go? He's been out the country for about 10 years and knows Shib, Dig, the scum pups, Bivouac, etc, etc. Although we can't remember his name. Another bloke was with us from London, who was public school gay into licking frogs and could talk to Claire about Paganism.","Fueled on booze we go all over the village, this involves one bad jazz gig, two clubs, one at which the local police turned up at, even though the place was empty, nothing happens, although the Belper bloke, who has a very strong accent and has the front of a stereotypical Manc, says “Hold on lads the coppers here, get your 5 dollars ready”. We walk back up the hill to the hostel at 4 in the morning. Great day, the next was motionless.","Claire's now on, only one cup of tea a day! Here's the photos....."],

Life is good here at last some sun, managed to get sun burnt twice already (thicko). Been busy though, more about that if it comes off. Are you bracing yourselves for Rick ( no offence Rick!).  Do you have an e mail address or is this this the only point of contact?  Funny who you meet in pubs, we made some good friends whilst away. you can share memories with them that your mates dont know about and if they did, they might not get it.

Before we knew it we where throwing ourselves around a hired jeep","We went up Pasachoa and watched a few eagles and condors. It gets cold up there but that was nothing next day was Pululahua and our first taste of snow and fog obscuring volcano views. Rick couldn't make this due to food poisoning at a dodgy Mexican.","Again the cold was really nothing, as the next day after helping a van out of the stream and our driver refusing to go any further, due to a recent jeep flip, we got out and put on more layers as the snow fell. We struggled up  (almost 5000 meters!) which was hell blizzard and made it to the refuged a bit frozen. No friendly fire waiting, just a scamming local, we soon descended and thawed out at a wonderful Guachai hacienda. We lit the fire in our rooms and took it easy for a while.","Next stop was the cosy spar town of Banos. We got straight into the thermal baths. The next day we absailed down some waterfalls. Truly scary, some of us neshed it. The biggest being 45 meters straight down, although total control, a beautiful experience. However, some evil insect manged to leave his spike in Claire at the bottom.","Back to the hostel for too much rum etc, broken chairs and telling off by neighbors, then up next morning for white water rafting for two hours down the Rio Negro.","After about our 10th meal at the brilliant hood cafe we headed back to Quito.. Here are some photos... Oh and Claire and I went to the center of the world...."],

In retrospect maybe this was a good thing as Mick dived over a huge wave not realising it would be much shallower on the other side and grated his nose on the sand. (oops) Scabby nose for at least a week.","We finally arrived in  Paddington's homeland. We met our tour guide for the day who was called Marcelles or Octopus to his friends, the reason behind this is that he did not have  any arms (PC ers out there he liked the nick name, he found it empowering ). He got by via a network of chains around his neck and an incredibly vivacious character. Very inspiring.","Then to Nasca and lines: Astrological calendar, fertility symbols, shaman guides or alien landing strip. You decide.","Then off we go sand surfing sounds easy, sliding down gentle slops, but oh no. Nobody tells you that you have to get there on foot. We set out at 9am a two hour trek which can only be described as a quarry path, We then reach the White Mountain which basically amounts to  a giant sand dune. We pay our respect to the mountain by giving it a drink of our water before we take our first step onto the sand. We then begin the hours assent. Mad dogs, four men and a English woman, go walking up a bloody great sand dune in the mid day sun.","After one attempt at standing up i resort to sliding down on my nether regions, Mick of course is  a natural until he has to stop, but he pulls off a magnificent somersault leaving him grazed and bruised. Battered and bleeding we complete a forty minute walk back to the car. We have sand in places we never realised existed.","After a 13 hour over night bus journey to Cusco I foolishly start to think I've conquered the art of urinating in a moving vehicle. Step 1:- Hold on with one arm whilst untying your trousers with the other  hand, keeping knees relaxed to absorb any unexpected bumps. Step 2:- Strategically hover over the stenching toilet, one hand turning white gripping on for life whilst the other holding on to your trousers in an attempt to keep them away from the toilet rim. Then suddenly I realise I've skipped  a step and forgot to get the toilet roll first, desperately I pounce for the toilet roll just as the bus swings round a corner I'm propelled against the toilet door and my dignity disappears down the chemical loo. Ladies please forward any alternative techniques.","Cusco is great, although we have not done much yet, although a cup of coca tea at the hotel John Peel died was 3 times more expensive than the norm, all in china and silver. See Video below. Also there's Cusco locals dancing for the virgin video. Please download, don't stream. Here's some pictures..."],

Four hours later and some wear and tear on our legs, we get to the bottom.","We meet a great group of people to spend a few days with but in no time  at all it becomes apparent that they are much younger and fitter than myself and mick. So after spending the night at the bottom of the Canyon instead of making the long climb to the summit we take Mules.","I of course get the largest lead mule and Mick gets the micro mule with no saddle. We end our journey by watching Condors and a visit to the hot springs a staggering 35 degrees.","Next we make  our pilgrimage to Lake Titicaca. Altitude, sun and wind at the lake take their toll and we are as red as very red berries that have been painted very bright red. Idiots. The lake was beautiful and the reed islands and the Aymey people were fascinating. I think their way of life truly has a lot to offer. When a family has  a dispute they simply chop the island up and float off and during community festivals they tie all the island together. They have been doing this longer than America has existed.

Bolivian buses are much the same, except the passengers tend to tell the driver to vamose! And women sleep on the floor, some passenger actually get in with the luggage under the bus as well. Anyway the bus going around the lake from Peru to Bolivia was full of tourists. In fact the bus from Copacabana to La Paz was full of tourists, it even stopped so people could take photos just as we descended into the city.  Anyway the bus full of internationals gets to the border for a meaningless ritual. We have to get out the bus, get papers, give away papers, pay 1 bob and walk into Bolivia.","Before we know it we are in Copacabana. The evil Manalow song is dancing our head. It is a sea resort for Bolivians, although it is no sea, its still lake Titicaca. We look in vain to find street signs, but do find a wonderus hostel that looks over the bay, with a really great restaurant where we eat and booze.","The next day we get up early and head for the island of the sun. The ferry slowly makes it way around to the north island. We walk the three hours to the south side, where the ferry will take us back. All is good, although our sandwiches have melted into their paper bags, we are still loving it.","Then we make the mistake. We go right. We should have gone left. We walk down the steep mountain path for around half an hour. Sitting in the scummy bay recovering from our decent we start to wonder where are the other ferry goers are. Times ticking on and the ferry is the last ferry. We ask a local fisherman in very broken Spanish. Shit, the other side of the island! We have half an hour to make it. Running up a steep hill at 4000 meters in full sun shine isn't that funny. Up to the top and flying down the other side. We do make it, all red faced and covered in sweat. Oh well."],

Say good bye to Copacabana and the one shoe shine boy, the drunken night with locals in the gratified bar and all of its half understood boozy chats.","Bus went as normal until: Wait! Get off the bus. The bus goes on one shaky ferry boat, we pay for another. The Bolivian Navy (!?) run this crossing as they have nothing else to do, we sit watching the bus bob up and down on a ferry behind us as we cross.","Bang! We are in La Paz and its hilly and crazy. Pollution: tick, Pirated dvd's: tick, lama foetus: tick, Arrange the bike ride for death road: tick.","DEATH ROAD is a one lane decent just outside of La Paz, and so called, as around 4 years ago on this gravel and dust path that is carved out of the mountainside, it was found to have an average of one fatality per day. The deadliest road in the world. This in mind, a new road was started and the formally two way road was made into a one way that changed direction at certain times of day, making the laughable reversing spots death traps redundant. Now most of the traffic uses  the new road, although a few villages that cling on to the side of death road make use of it.","Its not the road side memorials, or rusted twisted metal of truck and bus carcases that make you careful cycling down, it's the sheer drops. Also the gravel makes it a very slippy ride, especially as you tend to use the brakes most time and you don't have a truck's weight to help you stick to the edge.","So we set out from the snowy peaks at a height of 4800 meters above sea level.  Our hands gloved and cold, our shoulders and upper backs soon to hurt. Roughly five hours later having travelled 40.6 mile whilst descending 3600 meters having stripped off our clothing on the way down due to the rise in temperature, butterflies and fauna we make it through waterfalls, streams and a few skids. Knackerd and a little saddle sore we have a beer before chilling at Coroico.","The next day we get a taxi with Quetchin women to a t-junction to pick up our 18 hour bus trip to Rurrenbaque. This road is not dissimilar to the death road: one lane, hair pin bends and reversing spots. Claire has to swap seats with me, so not be next to the window. Sleeping pills and \"Colour me Kubrick\" on the zen does not help the hellish time in a bus seat but once again we make it."],

        "description": ["We make our way down to the middle of no where - Uyuni. On the way we pass through a city where some dodgy bloke whipped my pop out of my hands. The Peruvian earthquake cause a maximum security prison to spill its contents, there are some 150 still at large, maybe he was one of them. Also we pass through the white city of Sucre and Potasi the highest and one of the most pillaged cities in the world.","Slowly we snake through the desert to Uyuni were we get our visas stamped to exit Bolivia and we book our trip to the salt plains. After a chilli night and purchasing of thick (not so sexy) black woolly legins we are very excited and some what nervous about the tour. We have read that it can reach -25 degrees in the evening. With no sleeping bag trusting the booking agent that lots of blankets will be available, we head off. Two Swiss, two Dutch and mick and I squish into  a 4 by 4's with the driver his wife and child . It soon becomes apparent that the guide and his wife only speak Spanish. Oh well.","The first stop was a train graveyard just out side of Uyuni. We soon discover that universal gesturing isn't ample to describe its history so after clambering over the trains for a few pics we are off. Apparently the train tracks of south America resemble a great big hand, taking their natural resources out to the ports. I guess when the continent could not be exploited any more is when the trains started to rust.","The ground gradually becomes whiter until we are in the thick and vast Salar de Uyuni. Bright white flat landscape stretching out to meet the horizon. Sun glasses are  a must as the glare of the white salt reflecting the sun at altitude is quite blinding. I have an over whelming urge to run around and cartwheel like an idiot and lick the salt, so of course I do and of course Mick joins me in our mad half hour. Once we are breathless which doesn't take long at altitude we visit the 'Salt Eyes'. Areas where the salt crust is so thin that the water underneath the salt bubbles to the surface. It looks like the water is boiling hot but as we plunge our hand into the water we only find that it is freezing cold.","We stop at Colchani a salt processing village to watch the men at work scraping the salt from the ground into a truck.  One man building a church out of the salt blocks and women making trinket boxes and ornaments from the salt. After a short drive we arrive at the Salt Hotel. Although almost unique (as there are two) it proves to be novel rather than inspiring but it has a small turquoise pool at its front where you can see the salt crystals forming that have a pearl like iridescent sheen about them. A fairies play ground.","The real weirdness continues when we drive across the salt plain to something called fish island, which is basically a island of dead coral with huge cacti on it some reaching over ten metres allegedly hundreds of years old. Very odd. People keep referring to the salt as ice and all is strange. We run around a bit more, before driving off to a mud walled village on the edge of the plain.","We are in one unheated room. The village is empty, although the Swiss women finds a door that opens on to some blokes house who is selling amongst other things beer. We and the Dutch couple get some beer in and before we know it we are trying to sleep on the ultra soft valley like mattresses. Its not cold though. Next we head out to a volcanic lake to see hundreds of flamingos, foxes and see the four wheel drives put to the test. The Jeep sort of climbs up the very uneven rock path, almost feel it push down on each wheel in a walking manner. I thought they were designed to drop your kids of at school.","In the centre of Salvador Dali Desert there are some bizarre rock formations that have been formed by the howling winds. Any how, we pass Laguna Colorada, natural blood red lakes caused by algae and we are off to another lodge for more beers and a very early rise.","We wake and leave around 4am, its very very cold. Around -9 but there are millions of stars glitter over head. We head over to see some geezers doing there stuff at an altitude of 5000 meters. The sight is amazing the sun rising casts our shadows over the steam emerging from the steaming pools of mud. I am very very very very cold, but its the only time of day they do this. Although the sun rises and instantly it gets warmer and clothes are shed.","We make our ways to the hot springs, but its too cold to get undressed, although its good to dip our feet in and take away the cold numbness. Then we visit our last natural beauty the Laguna Verde, natural green volcanic lake caused by arsenic and other minerals. The Volcan Lieancabur is reflected perfectly and it is airily quiet. The volcano lies in the middle of the Bolivia Chile border. We wave goodbye to Bolivia and it feels like goodbye to South America, as Chile feels European. Its hot in the town we arrive in, really hot, walking in the shadows hot. The prices here shoot up and we loose our focus. We ignore the English cove, wine tours and astronomy and get down to Santiago after a quick stop off for a cold picnic on the beach. Soon we leap across the ocean, leaving the bad Spanish behind and landing on Samhain (Halloween)."],

Oh and also five hours waiting in a Chilean airport, 13 hour flight with over excited Argentinian and Brazilian teenage sports people and then another five hours waiting for the hostel to open eh!","This didn't stop us hiring a van and booking a trip up north. The van cost us around a grand (English) for 50 days. The first Auckland hostel had a rule on every wall and rivets on the stairs that sent Claire flying. So we went to another.","Back to Santiago, we did climb a city hill and saw the palm trees, greenery, buildings and smog. However, the smog was nothing compared to other cities we've been (Harry). Also we did go out in a groovy university area and met some balloon benders, they didn't know Paxo though. Talking of Paxo, for those know him, he should now be slowly returning from kicking butt in Israel or is that climbing olive trees and sticking onions up his nose.","Samhain was celebrated under the tree who's roots were as big as the branches and we then head off out for a meal. Mick's first curry in four months. Too tired and grumpy to see in the new year we sleep. Next day we went to the Auckland Museum, which was great, although very big and we ran out of time and missed out the history of Auckland on the top floor and some world war two stuff.","Another highlight was Maorioke on TV which is.... like pop idol but with Maori's. All full on tattooed faces but very genuine and articulate musical criticism. Also got drunk with a two islanders that where on holiday in Auckland but are now living in Australia. We also met a widower from the south island as the fireworks went off outside the smoking shack. On the real bomb fire night we where meant to go to the beach but the rain was relentless and it hasn't really stopped yet.","We pick up the van on Thursday the 8th and Claire is shitting her self about driving it....."],

        "description": ["Well we left the popping sound of the shrimps at the mangroves of the bay of islands behind and headed back on the \"no eating or drinking\" bus. We then slogged our bags up back to the trusty international kiwi hotel and back to our much anticipated Chilli that we had waiting for us in the fridge there.","Tomorrow was the day. Tomorrow we picked up the van. We wake fumble around and get the link bus over town before arriving at the van depot. Before we know it Claire is commanding our new beast through the hectic crossovers of Auckland. Driving the van took some getting used too. Claire legs gave away with nervousness and hands turned into two buckets of sweat. But any way it was straight on to the mess of lanes that leads out of Auckland! Quiet hellish, five hours later and Claire is now capable of driving rick's bus. Maybe...  We head out of the city and to the west cost and the surfing (and surfing accident tv program) town of Pihi. Amazing.","We get a camp site for 20 dollars a night and head out on to the beach. Before we know it we are cooking curries, climbing the loin (which is a huge rock type mountain on the beach), climbing through the woodland, watching waterfalls and enjoying a jug of ale at the bowling club. Once you leave the city everything disappears, including petrol stations and shops. We are slowly getting used to it.","Next we aim across to the other coast and the hot water beach. Very long windy drive that takes us across very south American type roads. The white roads from one coast to the other are windy and without tarmac. Yes pampered Liz might be looking at us from the currency but all is not the same here.","Johnny, you would have love thr hot water beach, perfect for building dams and channels and with the added advantage you can scowled the poor fella that's trying to relax in a sand pool just below your network. Its very odd, there's the sea and its freezing, but if you dig a hole in the sand here, its very, very hot, when the waters run into each other its sends the sensors in your feet a bit dolally.","We also went and for a walk to look at Cathedral cave, all very impressive, natural and free. But not long before we where back in the van and travelling down to Rotorua where we are currently at and trying to keep within budget. Although most days we can spend walking around a lake or through red woods and listen to the trees creak like doors in the wind before coming back on site and jumping in the steam pool to relax and let the thoughts of dates, money, plans turn into the feast we are gonna cook in the steam oven. Steam and ugly sulphar smells are every where.  All the houses around here have hot water steam pools and all the campsites and hotels also. Steam comes up from the drains and sometimes bubbles through the concrete.  Don't stray from the path or the geezers will get you. After a good sit in the pool you become dozzy, the day is grillaint and the food was yumally.","The Napian (Art Deco city of the north island) camp site handyman (not the owner he's from the UK) says NZ is experience the youth drain, well after the brain and the skills drain. Also the English and the Americans are buying up the land and ruining it. He said that the 4 million kiwi people have been lucky to keep back the tied until now, but the future is bleak.","We have found more  LP's on Claire's Zen and cheap wine, although the van has no plugs so everything that needs charging up is now flat. Hungry ducks everywhere and a lot of other weird walking birds with weird random song. We also saw black swans (Zoe they do exist!).","Happy birthday Paul (a fellow 21ster) last birthday as a single man."],

        "title": "Leaving the North",
        "description": ["So we left the free hot pool and headed south to the lake of Rotorua and a free camp site. Lake Rotorua is nearly as big as Singapore and is the home to the odd flying plane. The beautiful free camp site a gently bubbling lake surrounded by grand old trees with Tuis perched in them there bizarre song echoing around us. The site looked like it had some permanent residents and there was a huge fire on Friday night. We stayed two days and took it easy daydreaming by the waters edge and feeding the ducks and ducklings, only going into town for supplies.","The next day we where going to head to Napier to see the art deco buildings and drink wine. This all changed, we decided to head towards the three volcanoes and the mountain called mount doom and Mordor in the lord of the rings film (sorry Gunner) but alas no sighting of Bill boo Bagins or Smegle. Any how we drove to a camp site and booked some transport to take us to the start of the track. Rummaging around in the van we found our boots still in there bleach plastic bags that we had to do entering NZ. They take the environment very seriously and you can see why. They x-ray your bags entering the country just in case you've ignored there advice at declaring certain items or you are carrying fruit etc. Instant fine if you do.","On to the walk which cost us 35 dollars each to get to and seemed a bit of a rip off. We left our names and details with the bus company in case we didn't make it for the last bus at 4.30pm and we set off on the 8 hour journey. The walk was amazing although South America has spoilt us a bit. The Devils Staircase and 'devils cat litter tray' ( 45 minute ascent and 25 minute ascent respectively) remind us how unfit we are. There where a lot of people concerned about how fast they where doing the crossing, although we where too, as the bus driver said if you where not back by 4:30 they would go with out you and phone search and rescue. Nice.","We set off at 8am and completed the walk jelly legged and walk drunk by 2.30pm. This was nothing to the people limbering up on the bus to the start no doubt. It was a great day and included some snow ball fights, strange views, a Beech wood, blue and emerald coloured glowing lakes and stinky sulphur all on a virtual tourist conveyor belt of the sweating and panting.","The next day the water was not warm on the camp site, Claire got our money back $ 28 whoo whoo and we headed to Wellington after a chip picnic on the way we end up on the outskirts of Welli ready for films, gigs, curry and all the trappings of this great city"],

        "description": ["Well, we are a billion blogs behind (about three). We left the north island on Friday the 23rd and now it's only 21 days to Christmas, which is very odd as it's chocolate melting summer here.","Anyway, we eat a curry in Wellington and want to see movies and gigs, but after we move out of the campsite/car park we are in hoping to camp on the Quay side, we find out the best ferry to get is in an hours time, unfortunate we have yet to go  to the Indian Embassy and sort out our Visa. It  looks like we will  have to wait until we get to Australia, where we envisage homeless new years and  lots of messing around.","But wait I'm getting ahead of myself, in Wellington we did have a day going up the hill on the hundred year old trolley car and walking through the gardens to the city as well as consuming curry. Did I mention we had a curry. Yes a curry. Yum a curry.","The north island sort of pails as we reach the empty highways of the south island. The crossing was great, all wind in the bay of the north island and then in to the green maze that greats you as you head into Piction.","According to Maori tradition a Maori leader set sail in his boat (the south island) to go fishing. He caught a large fish that he bought to the surface ( the north island) and there it stayed until his brothers got hungry and and took big bites out of it. Any hu.","We go straight to Canvastown which was called this due to it being a town of tents for a year whilst people rushed around after gold, this is the story of much of the south island. The camp site we decide to stay in is in an amazing setting next to a crystal clear river (which soon we discover, every river is in the south island). This is rural, the kitchen has a dozen flies darting around and it all has the feel of a Steven King movie. There are old turned up posters in  the TV room about the gold rush and creaking swings in the breeze. Everything is lazy and dead as we are in the shoulder season. Apparently this place fills up in December, but tonight we see one man sit in the TV room on his own surrounded by darkness  serial killer, no doubt. We park up and go for a walk through the feral woods full of tree spirits and trixy pixies to a spooky cave to watch the glow worms do there thing. Then it's back to the van to get bitten to death by a zillion sand flies. As the van gets taken over I Claire become a sand fly serial killer. (it was either them or me). We later learn that it is only the female that bites in order to obtain protein to produce her young. How guilty did I feel !","Next day, we are still alive and we want to head north to Marahau and sea kyaking, seal watching and big beaches. This we do and manage to find a parking place overlooking this wide beach which does not have a no camping sign. Result! The tide here is remarkable and goes out into the distance leaving cockles, cusion star fish and mud skipers that tickle your feet behind . Before you know it the tide is back in. Apparently it goes out at the speed of 2cm a minute. On our first night we watch a wonderful sun melt into the sea to be followed by clear sky and an almost full moon. On the full moon a group of women gather on the beach, pagans no doubt, but to my surprise they were sat around howling Queen songs. ( George is clearly not on her own.) We go for a tramp through the reserve and the sun flickers through the great verity of trees. We see  a pair of Quails with about nine chicks  they are hilarious. They have wings but for some reason they refuse to use them and run round like demented souls. I (Claire) add to my list of misdemeanour's and become  a camp-site water thief.","The next day after shopping around we get a half day kayaking to see split apple rock and paddle through the granite caves near by and the rest of the day up the coast past an island with one invisible seal on to the incredible, but fast walk back down the coast. We paddle back to the boat which should be taking us back to the bay where the van is. But no the tide is out so we have another hour walk through the reserve back to the van. A long day.","I didn't mention Nelson did I, well we passed it on the way up and its great little town with a huge golden beach. No matter, we head back there and stay in the car park near the beach, which Claire finds out via some fellow sleeping-in-a-van Germans that it is ok to park in over night.","Four days without a shower begins to take control of our sanity so we finally come to term with paying for  a campsite. So its off to the west coast to see sun set over Carters Beach, although we find that its too windy to stay out. We check in to a holiday camp and wash and charge everything up and cook a curry which we will eat in various forms over the next few days.","From my beach we go down the coast and see blow holes and pancake rocks, seals and the cheeky wood hen or western Welke. All good, then its on to the Glaciers! But that's for next time, as is the  astounding Haase pass, the amazing Wanaka, the dull Queenstown and  comedy moustaches ... etc etc...."],

        "description": ["After making quicker than expected progress we find ourselves in cooler air around the Franz Josef Glacier. According to Maori tradition a girl was mesmerised by the mountains and convinced her lover to walk amongst the mountains, her lover fell to his death and she cried and cried until her tears fell for so long that she caused and avalanche which lead to the creation of the Glaciers.  At 6pm we find the local guide office open and with some trepidation ( after the agent saying we had to be pretty fit and have good  knee bendage) we book ourselves on the eight hour hike around the Glacier. We spend the night in a car park with no toilet. The only toilet they do have in town costs 50 cents and is fully automated with toilet roll measured for you, what ever business you have planned to conduct in there. The best/worst thing about HAL is that it starts to blare out mid flow   What the world needs now is love sweet love.","As night falls the van starts to get colder but the stars get brighter and we see four shooting stars. Waking up to the sound of giant angry wasps (or helicopters) and a wonderful view of the snow capped mountain. The helichoppers here are not used for weather or police which is all good, but tourists which is ok.","We have a humungus faff as we are all fitted out with climbing gear: Boots, crampons etc. Hurrah we finally approach the awesome glacier. We attach our crampons and take our first stiff steps onto the ice.","Throughout the day the guides constantly chip away at the ice to maintain the steps, Mick observed that the smashed pieces of ice resembled a Sneinton carpark. Up we trudged hanging on for dear life as we hauled ourselves up the steps pulling on to the ropes to assist our accent.  As we get towards the top each guide with a  maximum of eight people find their own unique way around the Glacier:  Climbing up and down ladders carved in the ice, slipping through vertical slides making our bodies somehow mould themselves for us to glide through impossible slits of concrete ice. Mick's camera runs out of juice and my camera freezes so no more pictures until a kind German steps in to take pics that we hopped he would email.","A wonderful experience. The water flows down the glaciers and into a very clear river which some time experiences a tsunami like wave when a huge peace of ice falls off the ice cave from where the river starts. The whole mountain is being chewed up by this and the colour of the snow starts to blend into the colour of the mountain at its base. Glaciers are constantly growing or receding. This one is growing at the moment, summer time. There are also some cheeky Kea that want walkers food. We didn't find Yoda's cave or superman's hide out, although we are sure it's there somewhere. Back off the snow we  are shattered and aching. So we celebrate with a glass of wine or three back at the van. The next day we decide to drive to Foxes Glacier and who should we meet in the secluded car layby but our German saviour, we down load the pics and head towards our next adventure.","The glaciers where called Victoria and Albert but Julius von Haast renamed them to Austro-Hungarian emperor and prime minster Fox in the last 1800's. You'll hear about that Dutchman on the next blog as we battle away through his pass...."],

        "description": ["Leaving the ice behind us, we visit blow holes and pancake rocks that are carved out of the west coast. All is good and free and makes the journey turn into an adventure, with welks, walks and views. These sights peeted out as we take the small road down to Jackson bay to a campsite there for recharging ourselves, and cleaning etc.","The camp was building up to this huge wedding to be held the following day on the beach. All the local land owners attending and"," top chiefs where gonna cook all day and everything was champaign and guests from abroad. Almost every older person we meet has close relatives who live in the UK or else where. They are downing a few drinks around a pre wedding bbq. We get advised that the Haast pass is some of the best scenery that NZ has to offer. This is good news as its where we are headed there next and we are not disappointed around every corner is something new, huge alpine mountains, great mistletoe woods"," and blue lakes"," The road crosses many creeks and all have names, including Robinson Creek, but no wolf creek, phhhew! Creek spotting is a good game.","We soon arrive at Wanaka, which is this neat little town which focus is a great clear lake that is fed from icy water from the surrounding snowy peaks. It's hot and kids are swimming in the freezing lake and people are just sun bathing by the shore. All is good apart from the no camping signs that are in every car park. So we head just out of town to Albert town which has a superb DOC (Department of Conservation) campsite, which is only 14 dollars a night. We didn't pay on our first night due to semi-confusion on how we get a receipt that we have to display on our vehicle. Due to this, the warden wakes us up and explains all and also lets us off the charge for that night. We do pay the next night. The site is dwarfed by huge pine trees and there is a clear gloopy (as its so cold) river that runs around it. Also there is a strange concrete grave yard that we didn't discover to just before left.","Sad to go, we leave for Queenstown, which we almost stay in. The campsite is rubbish, expensive and much like a carpark. Claire gets our money back and we leave. But before we do, we indulged ourselves in a bit of jet boat action at Shootover River. The powerful beast has us wet in no time and we are off towards Milford Sounds.","Te Anau is our stop off on the way. We book into a campsite and charge and cook sheep-less potato top or Shepard-less pie. The town sits around a huge lake and we go to the DOC centre and get local info about walks and DOC campsites. They have a wildlife reserve there also, where we get to see a lot of cheeky critters and learn that Kea have a tendency to eat cars tyres and really should not be encouraged or fed.","The next day is another wonderful day driving up Milford road which is just amazing and does not come across on our photos. Travelling towards Milford you have to drive through this dripping dank dark death tunnel that goes through one of the huge mountains and has traffic lights at either end. It was very unexpected and put another credit on bears outstanding driving record.","We get there and it's beautiful but really there is just a ferry port with no campsite. So we have to head back through the tunnel and find the nearest site, we head down Hollyford track to a back water sand fly reserve that is owned by the descendent of Mr Gunn (a big name around these parts). Its a wonderful basic place, powered by generators and has a certain old hippy charm and a huge hollow tree called hells bells, that looks like the tree off sleepy hollow. The only bad thing is sand flies are everywhere and they drink up your blood like wine. Moari legend maintains that they are there to prevent people from becoming lazy in the beautiful Fiordland. Also the flying kiwi adventure bus is here, which seems to be following us. We would have stayed here longer, looking at the free museum and go for more drunken walks in search of glow worms in the pitch black, but the sand fly just suck, suck and suck.","So we leave and go back down Milford road and walk around mistletoe lake, stop off back in Te Anau before heading to Clifden to stay next to a free DOC campsite near the unused but historic Clifden suspension bridge. And we are not even in Bristol.","We sleep well and head for Clifden caves to see glow worms the next morning (ok, afternoon). The caves are a bit hairy, lots of sliding head first etc and with our failing torch, we nesh it and get back in the van, just after a bunch of children come out with head torches on. Enough of crawling around slimy caves in the dark and banging our heads, we are off to the south coast via Invercargil for charging, food buying petrol and booze. The town is a horrid functional grid and has lots of punky type kids disobeying the no skateboard signs. We soon leave and head for a doc and trampoline campsite in Papatowai. The scenery changes yet again the rolling hills are so perfectly formed they resemble the telly tubby hills and the hundreds of sheep dotted across them remind us of fuzzy felts. A bit of a confusing drive, but we get to this tiny town and the campsite is cheap and had all amenities that you would find at a commercial campsite and its next to the beach and it had a trampoline. Did I mention the trampoline of industrial size. Yes that's right a trampoline and mini mini bunnies and great fan tail martial art type birds twirling around catching insects. Also Gordon the weird warden.","The next couple of days we have walks around the beach and picnics and generally chill for a bit, before heading back along the coast to porpoise bay to try to see dolphins (we fail), but we do see the rare yellow-eyed penguins and sea loins on the beach, very amazing. Its quite bizarre to see penguins on a sunny sandy beach and their chicks in the surrounding bush. They don't teach you that in school."],

        "description": ["The Catlins is a great area. This became even more apparent as we headed up to Dunedin, due to the  rain and everything that was free, such as penguin watching, suddenly had a price tag. Dunedin  was purchased from the  Moari for a song by a bunch of Scottish and the Scotts eventually settled here a couple of years later. The city takes after Edinburgh, it even has a Princes Street. Its very arty and costly. We went straight out to the Otago Peninisula and found a secluded lay by with a great view of the beach and set up camp. We saw a Royal Albatross that day, but didn't get that close as it cost 35 dollars each. They have a wing span of 3-5 meters and mate for life, but they separate to fly around the world in opposite directions, returning to the same breeding ground once every two years. They share the 11 week incubation period and then fly off on their lonely way.","We went back to the hilly town of Dunedin and spent a night listening to the local student radio. The next day we left, with a lengthy stop off at the odd spherical alien like rocks at Moeraki. The mountainside seems to give birth to these balls of rock. Then it was a great leap forward into Peel Forest where the van's sliding door stopped locking that left the van unsecured and unable to move. Hell! Claire phoned the AA. After talking to the DOC grounds man he saw what was wrong with the door. He was great bloke: An ex-farmer and now is some what of a traveller. Anyway it was three bolts that had fallen off from the inside of the door . We got charged a call out fee, but Claire is oh so determined to get it back from the van hire people. From the beginning of December (not the end of summer) the towns around here have xmas decorations and even decorated trees although it seems a bit odd. We have now tinselled up our van and are gonna have a roast of sorts on the 21st. Happy birthday Johnny.","We head to Christchurch and find a camp and eat reheats. Nice city but before we know it we are off again heading to Arthur pass. Me hobbling along with flippity flop walking wounds . We go through Sheffield (no anvil) and Springfield (no Homer) and to Arthur Pass Village which is situated in a rainy little valley by a railway track. We go to the deserted DOC campsite, only to be greeted by a noisy kea, clip clopping on the tin roof and poking his beak down at us. Is this good luck... time will tell.","Arthur's pass just seems like a rain trap, fingers from the sky tapped at our roof all night and so did a kea (see video, when we up load some videos). So we left the rain for Hanmer and hot springs. A long day of driving and we get there. We park up and relax. Next day we leave for the better springs down the road, well an hour down the road.","We plunge into the black pools thick with ash and the early morning struggles float away. But the sand fly are back and eating Bears nose and the paranoid fly float around us like a cloud. The anticoagulant the flies generously give you don't half make you itch the next day. We get away from them and go to the inside pools. No flies but they are segregated as people go nude into these rooms. Luckily we are the only people there and we individually slide into the dark velvety waters in the Japanese bathrooms. Bliss.","Revitalised we drive back past Hanmer and on the east coast and the whale watching town of Kaikoura. After a day of rest, we head out into the sea and see whales dive and dusty dolphins jump which was of course amazing. Now Christmas looms near, less than a week and we must head back to Christchurch for a Yule festival meal and shed a tear as we say goodbye to our van. No more moshing to the clash as we trundle down the road, no more late night listening to podcasts and learning about good music sites like http://www.stereogum.com or http://www.daytrotter.com. Also we had a voice reply on a podcast to email we sent asking them about Melbourne. They told us what to do and where to go, its sounds great. Anyway, back to the no mores. No more driving to the cliff edge and watching the Bull Kelp lap around like hair. No more watching the temperature jump form 10 to 27 degrees in matter of hours. No more bear spitting out toothpaste in high gales and watching it disappeared from the side to the back of the van. Maybe this is a good thing as the AA are about to go on strike here. We will soon be in Sydney,  homeless and skint. The year is ending and all I'm thinking is what's happened to frog watch johnny and why do people use facebook, it's rubbish."],

        "description": ["Christmas is over, New year has broke and now Claire and I are trying to claw back some energy at the edge of the blue mountains just outside of Sydney. We need to return to Sydney in a couple of days: One, for the street festival and two, to pick up our passports from the Indian High commission (hopefully). Then its off to Melbourne.","It seem like a long time ago since we left NZ. It's a place of a lot of firsts: The first place in the world to get a welfare state program; The first place the women's suffrage movement got the vote; The first transgender mp in 1999 and first rasta MP.  Also the Kiwi's take environmental issues seriously, although some Germans would disagree, complaining about the crop spraying and bad recycling. They still have no nuclear power and refuse American nuclear war ships to dock in their harbours. The remains of Rainbow warrior are is still in Auckland after the French blew it up. The indignations population (Maori) seem to be more reconsigned than other post colonies, with land reclaim and social contracts. Although there are some dark history concerning Chinese settlers. Not a bad place at all, although we met a few racist macho sexist Kiwi and some concerned about the amount of laws being brought in - Rules for fools. Although lot of Kiwi are leaving for the 30% wage hike in Australia. We also went over to Australia after early morning taxi ride with a cook islander driver. We pay our departure tax and fly off to Sydney.","But hold on I'm getting ahead of myself. On the morning of the 22nd , at 4.30am we head out in the dark towards a field. Here the sun starts to rise after the longest day and we climb into a wicker basket and ascend gracefully into the clear sky. I've always wanted to go into a balloon and it didn't disappoint. Some farmers hate them, some like them and the cows in the field we landed in seemed very curious. Amazing experience and learnt a lot about being held up just by hot air. The Balloons last about 500 flights and are made in Bristol. After we scare some cows on landing, we drink sham-cider and  head back to the camp site to clean up the van. This as you may guess is quiet a long process and sad. We will miss the van. 5310 KM in 46 days  and it was a great time. We were expecting problems handing the van back, but it all seem to go smoothly.","We had had our xmas dinner on the Johnny's birthday, went out for Thai on our 2nd anniversary but on xmas day itself we had beans on to toast. However, later Christmas day, we went hunting for food, and eventually we found only one Thai restaurant open. The street it was on had hundreds of other places to eat but where resting. The food there though was surprisingly good.","The one thing we got through the post to the hostel was from the might Karl. A five disc digital surprise and a surprise horse. Hat's off to you Karl, buy you a curry in India.","The thing about Sydney to me is: Bats. They have these great fruit bats or flying foxes, they just hang like fruit from the trees in the botanical gardens, all wrapped up in their leathery wings and then fly across the city at dusk. They are actually ginger and very big. I wonder what Molly would make of them??","It's was very touch and go if we where gonna get a place to stay new years eve. We had some good luck one couple who booked a double en suite room fail to show and we where able to take full advantage. On New Years Eve we also got a good position to stand (although it could have been closer to the bogs) between  Sydney harbour bridge and just across the water from the opera house. We get down there about mid day and there is a sea of umbrellas, not for the rain but to hide from the sweltering sun. We quickly run off and buy our own. It then starts to happen. By-planes flying over, other planes writing messages in the sky. Whistles are being handed out. All was fine and dandy until, of course, at 10pm, I predictably become desperate for the loo. It takes me 30 mins to get through the crowd and then there is a huge queue for anyone to relieve themselves. I finally start to fight my way through the crowd to try and get back to Mick who has all the money, cards and train passes and we have no emergency meeting place. So faced with impending doom I push, plead explain and eventually break down until I rest in the arms of Mick to the surrounding crowds surprise. Hurah!! The surrounding crowd included a Australian who worked in png and a Sikh guy, who Mick was ranting with. Also we met a cool couple from Munich and Manchester that where upholding a 5 year long distance relationship. Respect. The fireworks light up the bay, the ships turn on their outline light strips. Bang 2008! Hope you had a good time."],

        "description": ["2008, it was time to leave Sydney for the Blue Mountains. One short train ride from central and we where there at Katoomba. We booked into a huge horrible hostel and got cheap wine. Four litres of wine here costs 10 dollars. That's around 5 quid. The next day we cooked in a stinky kitchen and headed out walking through town and out the other side look for the blue mountains.","The blue haze of these hills is due to the mist the oily stuff given off by eucalyptus. Here you can see the three sisters, legend goes that a father was scared that the local bunyip would capture his daughters so when the father went away he would leave them on a shelf of  a mountain where he thought they would be safe. Needless to say the bunyip tried to get the women and so the father turned them into stone to protect them but before he knew it the bunyip chased the father. During his escape he lost his magic bone (obviously not what you want to happen) thus the three sisters remain in rock formation waiting for their father to his ruddy magic bone. Any who what's good about this walk is when you get there you already at the top and below you stretches a rolling green valley. They have flies though, Melbourne has them also but not as much and also does Ayers rock, but you can always jump in the pool to avoid them there. I should imagine there is a huge fly army waiting to drink but not bite our skin in Cairns.","Currently we are at Ayres rock resort. The soil is red, the sun is hot, the leafs and bark on the floor looks as though they have been burnt. Its formidable and dangerous: The news tells of a local couple ran out of water but got to a dry watering hole and died. Not here though, not in this hostel/hotel thing. Here the alcohol is expensive and rationed, but the pool is free and the blue dragon fly swoop across its surface twisting playfully with each other.  Its just good to fool around in the water and cool down.","Anyway after the blue mountain we returned to Sydney to another room at the same hostel. We must have slept in most of the rooms in that place. The following day was almost like new years again. It was Sydney festival and Bryan Wilson was playing for nowt. We spent the day dodging around town looking at the stuff going off and also re-visiting the bats. Before we knew it we where wandering through the Sydney streets back to our beds. The next night was spent on the greyhound to Melbourne but first we watched No country for old men. Yet another bloody film that we seem to be watching recently. Oh and we managed to get our Indian visa after much ticket taking, photocopying and doling out of Australian dollars.","We get to Melbourne and we have a few nights at the nunnery. Hellishly hot. In the 40's. We walk across town to get our washing done and a swim in the internet at world wide wash, but they have shut up shop because of the heat. This town is wonderful, but melting. We tram across town at dusk for  the moonlight cinema and Dawn rescue in the botanical gardens. A great night. We had already got a hot tip on good cheap curries from an taxi driver from Iraq. This taxi driver was from Greece and had a story or two. A few days near (ish) the beach and drinking at the Esplanade hotel and we were back on a plane again and off to the desert. We are now waiting for a night and a chance to learn about the southern hemisphere's stars. I'm currently wondering if the English gambler we met in Melbourne has won. He won his ticket for this high stake poker game over the internet and is now sponsored. He has lived in Kenya, not a place to be at the moment and has been working in casinos all his life. Now he's sat on the other side trying to get the 200,000 dollar carrot.","The flight path takes us over the red inhospitable desert and as we come into land we catch a glimpse of Ularu protruding from the earth. We alight the plane and feel the rush of warm air as the 41 degree heat greets us. We find ourselves captive at the Ayers rock resort where everything is too expensive but the sun set over Ularu was free. The rock is a truly serene site and you can't help but feel the generations of shared wisdom that has passed through this magical place. The following day was spent in the pool and a bus out to the observatory to learn of the mountain on Mars that is 26K high and reaches outside it's atmosphere. How some people want to climb it. The southern cross and the false cross. The million star cluster, the unimaginable distances and how really small the biggest thing here is.  The unchanging moon creators. The 13th star sign. How only the Chinese astrology makes a sort of sense and how I might be a rat, no looked it up I'm a metal pig and bear is a wooden tiger. Oh, happy birthday Sarah for the 13th, hope you had a good one! It's Claire's birthday next week (the 25th) we intend to be on the reef with the fishes.","Another early morning start 4am to see the sun rise at Uleru and we take a guided walk around the base to look at cave paintings and watering hole that has water all year round even when it doesn't rain for  a couple of years. The rock was created by sediment building up in a water basin then the moving of tectonic plates pushed the rock out of the earth but it is actually on its side and you can see the sediment layers lye vertically in the rock. We then go to the cultural centre which is great, but we have little time to take in all the aboriginal information. It's amazing anyone can survive out there and it wasn't so long ago that they got land rights back and where given compensation for the stolen generation.","Australia is a strange place, due to the 25 million years this continent has been isolated and free of land bridge. The tree's keep their leafs and shed their bark, some animals hop, some are horny devils and the dreams of inhabitance take some understanding. A history of racism and messing up the fragile environment by diverting water and introducing rabbits, frogs and wild camels. Maybe things would have been different if America had not won independence so forcing the  Empire to move its penal colony down under and naming the town after the home secretary  Lord Sydney."],

        "description": ["We fly into Cairns away from the dry heat and into the wet heat. Humid. This is a resort town and has little soul. We are only here so we can get up to Cape Tribulation, where the rain forest meets the sea and where Captain cook ran into coral that messed his boat up. There's also a lot mangrove bog land as well, this apparently works with the coral. Coral is an animal that derives 95% of its food through a symbiotic relationship with photosynthesising plants. It comes all shapes sizes and colours and is a city of sea life. Really wonderful. Any hoot we get a bit of a tour up there, as its the cheapest way to get. We jump in a van,then run around a rainforest and make it up to the beach house, a collection of huts in the forest and right on the beach as well. Great place with a huge pool and bar. Also it has huge spiders, snakes, stick insects and a billion mozzies. That said, as soon as we arrive we decide we want to spend more time here. It's also croc country and whilst out walking along an empty beach (can't swim due to evil jelly fish) we see a sign saying that a salty had been spotted around that area in the last few days and to be careful. Also cassowary are about. They are like a cross between an emu and a turkey. They have a middle claw called the disembowelling claw e also and have killed people, including a 6 year old a couple of years ago. They are also endangered and are extremely important at keeping the rainforest going as they are great at distributing seeds. We did see one in the wild and they are very strange creatures. We didn't see many crocs as it was too hot for them, although we did see a mother croc guarding her eggs from a boat.","125 million years old forest that sort of hasn't changed much apart from the cane toads. Another classic opps, should not have introduced that animal Australian story. They where growing sugar cane and decide to introduce a 100 frogs which eat the bugs that eat the cane. Well that's how it works in south America, in Australia the bugs are too high up for the frogs to eat, so instead they bred like crazy upset the local food chain. They are highly poisonous and give off hallucinogenic sweat and have no natural predator. They are helping to destroy the rain forest. Also rabbits and foxes where introduce for hunting and the domestic cat is now five times as big and very feral. Also there are no red seeder trees to be found as it took loggers 25 years to take them all. Other tree's to watch out for are ones that have heart shaped leafs and grow at the edge of the forest often near paths or clearings and they are poisonous. Then there is a waitawhile which is a vine with barbs that will stick in your clothes and you have to unhook them. Is not a good idea to run through the forest and apparently a man orienteering lost an eye after brushing past a waitawhile. There are lots of barbs and hooks here.","So we are streaming with sweat and after a brief stern explanation of how the beach house works and not to leave food out as critters might go for you after they have your food. We hump our bags to our hut and then hit the pool. Where we meet a English-South-African-Australian women and her kid Jonah. She has a billion stories and all are funny and unusual. Her dad sounded quiet a character as well. Born in England, gives up his English passport to live in South Africa with his wife, who starts to die of cancer so they travel around the world, she dies. He meets an American women and moves to America, get bored and moves to Mexico where he seems to carry on drinking heavily and moving from rich widow to rich widow.","Anyway a lot of people are going on a forest at night nature tour, we decide to leave it and see what they think tomorrow. There is a huge, huge spider above the pool (Darth Vader) and several around our hut (harvey, harold and twinkle toes). That night whilst drinking and chatting to other people who share our hut, a huge snake comes out of the jungle and makes its way across the patio. The other people where a English journalist student and a hardcore techno DJ. There seems to be a lot of in debt students around travelling. I think they might have a life of repayment in front of them, We also see toads jumping around. There are heavy noises out in the woods, who knows what they could be.","The next day we decide to walk to a water hole, which is basically a stream that you can swim in. That means no crocs and no jellyfish. Its a hard walk along the road in the hot weather. By the time we get there we are ready to be cool. However the water is quiet cold and shaded. We get in though. There a few Spanish girls swimming there and an English family.","Then Jonah and his mum turn up and start to feed the hidden fish, this also attracts eels. Eels are not shy and one bites Jonah. Not hard but enough to freak us out a bit, one goes for Mick and he splashes around to avoid it. We keep out the water after this and after a quick visit to the bottle shop we hike back. We make the mistake of trying the beach walk home but the tide is in and we have to turn back.","By the time we make it back to the beach house, we are ready to jump in the pool again. We also see a weird lizard running down the path on his hind legs, very strange like something off eXistenZ. We meet a English girl that is very freaked out after she stepped over a dangerous snake. Day seem to go by like this until we leave for Port Douglas.","It's the day before Claire's birthday and we wake up early to get the bus to the habitat and to have breakfast with the birds. The food is great, load of weird tropical fruit and a bunch of fried food as well. The place was great, feeding kangaroos and stroking emu and crocs. Spent the whole day there, it was a right laugh. I don't really like zoo's, I see them as a prison, but this place took in injured animals and the people who work there where very into what they where doing.","Then back to Port Douglas and the bus back to Cairns. We count our mosquito bites Mick a total of 11 Claire left foot 4, left arm 5 left leg 4, sides 2 back 13 clearly my right side is much more attractive than my left. Right arm 18 right foot 20 amounting to grand total of 73 itchy pussy wounds yum. Mick obviously must taste bitter.  We check in to a hostel and hit the sack as we have an early rise to go to the great barrier reef on Claire's birthday. We wake, get tagged and herded to the boat and out we go. We arrive at Michaelmas Cay, which is a bird sanctuary and alive with squawking. After a quick snorkel lesson, we are chasing colourful fish around different coral structures and past huge giant clams. Amazing. Then we get back eat a Thai meal and have a drink or two. The next day is Australian day, but we don't do much but chill in the shade in the park. Thanks for the birthday emails guys they meant a lot being the other side of the world and all. Gooday."],

The hubbub and the chaos hits us immediately, but before you know it we are squeezed into an air conditioned taxi and we are hurtling through the streets of Mumbai.","We drive through some of the slums and we knew their would be poverty but nothing can quite prepare you for the sight of whole families under make shift shelters on the pavement. The taxi pulls up outside a dubious looking establishment. We make our way upstairs where our fears are confirmed. We carefully rap ourselves up in our sleeping bag liners. It feels like an 19th century brothel but we are still laughing, well at least for a while until our laughter and duty free cant fight off reality any more.","It's the forth day in Mumbai and the jet lag has just about gone, we are now getting up in the afternoon as normal. We have parked ourselves in the Cowes, a hotel in the Colaba area, not far from the bay. The hotel is over staffed and under maintained. The area is. The drains are. The ravens and sleeping dogs, the shitty dust where the pavement has been broken up will help to break your nerve. The women with the monkey on the leach or the blind man stamping his staff might help. There's always the old man deeply lost in religion with a weird chant and an instrument that is like two metal flat sticks and some sort of semi circle clasp at the bottom: Twang, twang, mantra, mantra, until a waiter at Leopolds (open since 1871) ushers him away.","There is a drawer in our room with a bunch of letters to the same person. Claire reckons it was the now dead previous tenet. We are on a side road off the main drag. The horn is used so you don't get run over, which would be easy to achieve. As would buying a giant balloon, bongo drums, peacock feather fans, Krishna mints and hash. As you know I used to live the Netherlands, didn't smoke hash then and it was semi-legal there.","We missed the end of one Mumbai festival, but that's OK as another one has started. We watched"," Tibetan dancing whilst following a city walk from the guide book. Bewildering city, Don't take any pictures of government buildings or they will have you. It's ok to take photo's of the gateway to India, where the British left. We walked around a park where there must have been at least a 100 cricket matches going off. We walked into the reservation centre to book a train to Goa, but it was worse than the website that doesn't take Visa. It's like a crazy housing benefit office. Hundreds of people in about 10 queues all shuffling and yearning, all clutching pages of bureaucrazy."," We gave up and booked an overnight A/C bus instead, we may get the train back.","There is a lot of colour here though. Layers of colour. In the sari's, in the paintings, especially in the food and in the flavour's of the food. I came here to get fat."],

        "description": ["Well my pirated copy of  book is strangely close to where we are at. He mentions Leopold, the café where we did most of initial eating and drinking. I picked this copy up off a street vendor, I had a go at bartering and ended up short changed and with a photocopied version. Oh well, it does the job and it only cost Rp 160 (about 2 English quid).","Our mission that day was to get off the island of Mumbai and go across the toxic waters to Elephanta island. We woke, I failed to get curry for breakfast, but did scoff two somosa. Mumbai seems to wake up late, so if you are dodging around at 9am, you will only get a few hellos rather than a pitch. Although the boat touts do pitch and before we know it we are on a very rocky tub of a boat, shouting and slurping our way through the hazy crowded harbour. Dropping off shopping and people on other boats as we went.","Most people in India are Hindu. Hindu is vast, complicated and full of destroyers, creators, cosmic dancers, sects, carnations, castes and and and a lot of stuff. It's as old as the hills and often has huge statues of multi-armed deities carved out in the hills. As we saw on Elephanta. Why is it called Elephanta? Well the British followed the Portuguese's naming. Still not clear? Well it used to have a great stone elephant. However it sort of fell down, so they moved it to Victoria park in Mumbai.","Elephanta has scenes carved out of the rock devoted to the activities of the Saivism sect of Hinduism and not Vaishnavism as you might have thought. No it's Shiva the great destroyer in many different carnations all carved out in the 7th Century."," Lots of cheeky monkeys, dogs and the odd raven as well occupy the island. Also there is a new charge around every corner with the last one being the most unexpected and painful. However, you can also pick up a dam tasty corn on the cob, char grilled for 12p. Not a bad trip and we met a bloke form Honolulu, that we had met in the middle of nowhere on the Kilatoa loop, way back in Ecuador."," I remember we where waiting for a bus on a dusty road. No bus stop, just faith that the bus would turn up and it did, we squeezed on board with our rucksacks and found some seats at the back. They where the only other western people on the bus. A real travellers moment. He, Jason, had been home and is now back travelling again.","We de-boated clambering through a few boats and headed back thought the chaos back to our stagnant hotel.","I had a bad nightmare about myself and Mick living in squallier in India, or could it have been Nottingham? I'm not sure, but I can remember thinking as I wearily stepped out of bed to go to the toilet: At least I haven't seen any rats . Hay presto as I put my hand on the light switch I feel I thud against my hip and something slide down my leg. I"," convince myself I just trod on my PJ bottoms but I suddenly see the little critter pop out from behind the furniture. It had clearly used my leg as a fireman's pole."," It was passed midnight but I had to pack all our clothes in case the rat chose our clothes for a bed or"," a toilet. The next day I decide that I didn't want to be a traveller any more. Just for one day I would like to be transported home to see friends and family to have a hot bath and clean sheets. (as I now believe my bites have been caused by bed bugs not mosquitoes. Oh well.","Curry for breakfast after check out and bag storage and then a taxi to toxic beach. After a sit taking in the quiet it was time for the game of dodging traffic and the shrill of their horns to get to Mani Bhavan or Gandi's Mumbai pad.","We saw his letter to Hitler (which starts off dear friend, Gandi was in league with Hitler! Put that in your propaganda model and smoke it!) and photo with Charlie Chaplin. After getting ripped off by crap taxi man and just the heat and hectic streets of Mumbai grinding us down we head back to our side of town for some good Lebanese food and then the bus hunt began. The bus will be the only bus near the Metro Cinema. Lies, lies, lies. Politeness gets in the way of truth here. We did find the bus eventually and the sleeper bus, is just that A/C bed compartments on a bus. Great.","We sleep on and off and experience weird motion sickness when we get to the city of Panaji in Goa. We get off the bus, it's morning and we are dazed, an Israeli who lived in Newcastle/London helps get our bags from under the bus and then we get a taxi to the hotel. I'm prying that it's a good one after the last couple of days we need a break. It's better and cheaper. Very good indeed, old Portuguese's building, mosaic bathroom, wooden four poster and hot shower! Hooraah!"],

We met a Swedish couple and before knew it there was a crowd of us waiting for the bus to Hampi.","The 9 hour bus journey turned into 14, but wasn't really that bad. Soon we were on a tuktuk bombing through the dusty village, past the snake charmers, monkeys and cows with huge horns to our basic room. This town is surrounded by huge red rocks and has a hell of lot of weird temple things.","Vicky's is where we are staying and his family runs the guest house. It has a roof top café where you can see cows, people's wanderings and people going about their day-to-day washing, sewing etc. We even witnessed a heated exchange of shoves and shouts. Eventually stopped by one women in a blue sari.","This is a dry town. No booze, anywhere, well apart from the government run hotel/bar. Ragoo is our rickshaw driver. His History and Economic education didn't help him get a job, so with a bank loan he got a rickshaw, he didn't want to break himself in the banana plantation like his father. His family follow baba part of Hindu and he has a sticker to prove this in the front of his rickshaw. He speaks many languages, one to his family, one to his mates, English to us. He spends the day showing us around the hundreds of temples. He will marry someone picked for him in two years time","It's hot though and its hard to hold interest, although the stone carvings are impressive. We wander through the vast stone city scape getting drunk by the sun and trying to find the columns that let out a musical tune if you tap them. There's squirrels moving as fast as lizards and monkeys rooting through a family's picnic bag as they look on laughing.","India is full of subtleties but its not subtle. I can see how people could become addicted to visiting here, in the way they like a drug that doesn't make them feel good a lot of the time. The last three beds have been a bit too small for me and I'm hardly tall, the power cuts out randomly here and the fan stops in the cell of a room we are renting. It gets hot quickly. We might have to invest in another copy of"," Shantaram as we both now are reading it. We will be reading it tonight as we are back on a sleeper bus and heading for the Goa coast again, leaving the great temples and the well cooked potatoes at Vickys."],

        "description": ["So the rickshaw drivers late, ultimately this doesngt matter as the bus has many complications before it leaves. Away from Hampi. A few things I missed out about Hampi: The bell pepper stealing monkey, which explains itself and the four o clock explosion. The rickshaw driver tells us that the distant explosion is from an Iron Ore mine, just out side the near by town. He also tells us children work in the mine. Ugly. But we are away on the sleeper, it's got bigger beds and a sliding door of privacy.","Early in the morning we shake our selves and fall out the bus to five people wanting our rickshaw custom. We get one to the beach and after a few samples of different hotels we pick one in this rough beach village. The rooms expensive and a bit rubbish, but so much better than Hampi. It has hot water and is huge. We go out in search of curry. Scruffy little beach with people floating around in the air. The whole day is the usual daze after a sleeper ride and we soon are flicking through the channels as  our consciousness fades.","The next day is Rigley's birthday. What does this mean. It means its valentine day. We move rooms which has a bath! But no hot water. We spend the day by the pool and then purchasing blankiephant (a sheet with elephants on). We watched the sun melt into the sea whilst eating more curry and drinking a kingfisher or two.","To the airport to meet Rachel. The Goa airport, which originally and still is a military airport. All is confusion and you cangt get into the airport. We where early and the plane was late. Three  hours later and we where getting our pre-paid taxi to Anjuna.","Hello! it is I rachel, making my brief (well I will try my best) appearance on this blog to tell you of my experiences of my trip from mumbai to kerralla and of the experiences I have gained on meeting these two nutters out here!","Where to start? well, I write this from the bathroom of our above average accommodation in kerralla. That is something compared with the  bathrooms I have seen during the journey so far as they have not been ones I have wished to spend time in, however, we have been blessed to find this room and clean bathroom in amongst the madness we have experienced so far. And to say that I am sat here now typing away whist Claire and Mick sleep is really something. This is a real rarity, a luxury, a bathroom which has seen bleach and such a departure from some of the harrowing things I have seen so far!  If I told you that I had seen shit seeping out of one of the airplane toilet doors coming here you probably wouldngt believe me, but sadly that was the truth and unlucky for me, my seat was just too close to the devastation. Mental note, dongt always go for the cheapest flight out there..","Moving on, from there!! swiftly does it, the plane gets into Mumbai, then I've to catch another to goa which is only 3 hours delayed, something to do with the airline company had not booked the landing space and some Indian guy also telling me that the Indian airforce may also be using the run way!! Either way it was hassle and upon arrival to Mumbai money was not forthcoming from the ATM machine but all was resolved by a nice Indian guy working in the airport who ever so trustingly lent me some money!! 1000 rupees as well! By god, I reckon I'd deserved that karma and it was a really good welcome to India. After that positive experience I eventually caught my flight to goa and got to meet the two nomads and begin the adventure..","Wow! some long taxi ride eventually got us to Anduna in goa, praise the lord!, we found accommodation easily complete with air conditioning , TV! and a maroon bath tub. I mean, what more could a girl ask for. Oh and the best curry later on that night for less than \u00a33.50, I really was content, oh and in a pretty fairy lit garden too with one, two a few kingfisher beers and then a bottle of carry out bacardi things became increasingly drunker.","Highlight of that night has probably got to be when we managed to lock ourselves out on our hotel room balcony, closing the double doors in attempt to stop the mosquitoes from invading, was probably not one of our better ideas as it also prevented us from getting back into the room! and left us at the mercy of the bloody mosquitoes.  Luckily we managed to call for help and all in good time, a bemused member of hotel staff opened the doors again, and then we continued to drink.. Chips were purchased that night and nurafen was taken and we woke up not in the best health the next day but we did manage to get some sunbathing in which I thought was pretty impressive and hardcore.","The next few days in Anduna for me were about sunbathing, cows on the beach and a really aggressive shop keeper woman demanding us to buy saris from her shop, oh and lots of lovely sea views and good curries at sunset. What a beautiful place, so many cows everywhere and scraggy mangy dogs who werengt so lovable. Oh and the night market on Saturday night, loads of bargains to be had an counterfeit sunglasses for the (sh)it girl here. Think we all did well that night, Mick has had a Bruce lee t shirt which has gone down well with the locals and Claire bought some fishermen pants and a dress for next to nothing. What a load of bargains! I say, much more economical to spend out here than in Primark.  Anyway, those are the nice bits of the blog. Oh and there's a visit to the spice farm, I'll mention just briefly before I go on about the train experience. For around three quid entrance fee, we got to see lots of different spices and fruits growing out on a plantation, and learnt loads of interesting facts like its dead difficult to grow cashew nuts, it grows off a fruit which is inedible and they have to roast it to detach the cashew and not so many grow on a tree. You also only get 250 narnas to an average banana tree, once the bananas are picked, the tree then gets cut and starts growing somewhere else, they call it the walking tree blah blah blah, you still reading ?. Well, we thought it was interesting anyway and the curry buffet was damned good.","Ok, the train journey to kerrala, what can I say, not orient express more like urine express. Seemed such a romantic idea to catch the train down the coast to kerrala, to share a cabin and watch the sunrise etc. Well, the reality of that was more of a moving prison cell complete with Bridewell style beds which we shared with three other men all within too close proximity! This was after spending almost 6 hours waiting in this station where drinking on the station was prohibited and the men were naturally mesmorised by mine and claires' beauty and good looks, to a point of uncomfort felt by all of us. Still, there was a little cute puppy running around the station, trying to play with an older scraggy dog I affectionately named 'one ear' (well actually had two but one was up, the other down) To get back to the story, the deformed dog seemed to play along with cute puppy and provided us with a good hours worth of time killing activity. Then there was the pub, erm the pub, what can I say. Quite a distinctive bathroom which will no doubt feature in the pictures complete with 2 dozen eggs freshly stored within close proximity of the toilet. Thank fuck we didngt order omelette!","Anyway, thanks to the wonders of diazepam and time which eventually passed we got off that nasty train and started the  next part of our journey in kerrala, which I will now leave to mick to tell you all about. Glad we got there in the end though. It has taken me ages to write this, two hours, and eight minutes to be exact! Hope your still with us on the old narrative.. See you! rachxxxx","Kerala elected CPI communist party. Is this why people where motor cycle helmets here? Why there are a million school children everywhere (98% literacy here)? Why there is high suicide rate and government ran bottle shops? Where the people in the queue feel uncomfortable that we are queuing as we are their guests and we feel uncomfortable jumping the queue so we dongt. Also all the open air restaurants serve beer in tea pots and mugs. There are Muslims, Janes, Jews, Christians and Hindus all living together here. We met a Muslim rickshaw driver and he took us all around Fort Cochin. We ignored many a temple and church, synagogue and one navel museum. We couldngt ignore the snake charmer, the chained elephants in some sort of Hindu festival and the ginger processing room. They rang the bell again and again and then a huge explosion. Before we knew it we were in a taxi again heading to house boat central and  it is rated in the top 10 things to do before you die in the often wrong lonely planet."],

        "description": ["The wonderful memories of the house boat trip were fading quickly in hectic roads of Alappuzha. I had developed a cold, which I generously would share with Claire. Rachel fell in love with This is England film that we watched on the laptop but it didn't stop her toilet trips. We all couldn't sleep. The hidden grimness of the hostel was moving in. We needed to leave. Let's get the first bus out of here! Or Taxi. We arranged with the slimy hostel owner (Stampy) a taxi out of there and on to the next town, which was a cliff and beach resort."," Varkalam is where we got to and bamboo haven. Shiva (the great destroyer) is the lad that is helping us out and he's great laugh. All is good with the world. We quickly got in a routine of playing with the huge waves in the Lakshadweep Sea and then letting the sun evaporate the water off. We fell into our books (well the one book Shantaram that we are sharing chapter by chapter) and the singing of the ananas women on the beach. Watch out for the dog packs though. Enjoy the view of great Indian coast line (ignore the rubbish, mostly plastic dumped here and there). Walk from the stalls down by the pissy or minty steps. Past the laid out washing drying on the rocks.","None of the bars here have licences, so when you buy a beer, they serve it in a mug and you keep the bottle under the table. They do have fresh dead fish outside the restaurants, usually including a huge sword fish, which I bet would have looked great alive. A bottle of wine costs. All booze costs, unless you go to a liquor store. Best not go at night, like we did. Rickshaw across town. It's down that dark and dusty alley, you have to squeeze past that truck, the driver indicated. Past the truck was a bared building"," front and counter. Men dotted about everywhere in the shadows and lined up next to a barb wired fence to counter. Claire was not covered up really not the best move. There where no other women here. There were only worn and hard looking Indians. The queue moved slowly. We hid in the shadows.Two bottles of your best rum please.. Yes thanks, thanks thanks. Back to the safety of the rickshaw and back to the coast.","Rachel has less time than us here, so must plan. A bit of a frantic back and forth decisions and she has arranged a route to the next town and bunch of adventures. Pondicherry has Rachel's curiosity after featuring in a book she has read, so she aims herself for there. But before she leaves she buys more and more clothes. Some of the pictures in the hostel make a good back drop for a photo shoot. As for us two, we are sneezing and confused. The mighty Karl is turning up in Mumbai next week and we are miles away. After a day or two trying to get our"," thoughts together, we just book a flight back to the crushing, biting town of Mumbai. Then we will head north with Karl to a fairy tail palace in Udaipur."," Although first we are going to have a holiday here and it's all wake up late, ignore the temples visits, jump in the sea and have a good curry and some rum before sleep brings us around to start it all over again. This is ferris wheel living."],

        "description": ["The days of beach reading and discussion of sea monsters, sand shelves, different types of drag and wave are gone. The days where we did Indian cookery classes are past. Claire's redundant yoga lesson, rum nights and late mornings have all dried up. We where back in a taxi heading to the airport. Mumbai domestic airport is so much better than the international one, but outside we are still confused and the two fold rip off taxi driver dodgers us around the sprawl of the screeching city.","All this fades as we meet the pail and calm face of Karl. Soon we are raising our glasses and filling our faces. We buy a copy of Shantaram and shove it Karl's hands, although he soon gets the sickness and we are haggling with a chemist to put him right. A day of waiting and then we take a two hour taxi drive across the city to a lesser train station. Its rush hour (8pm) and normally this would take 30 minutes. Super crazy traffic compete for space. All beeping all jerking back and forth. Motorbikes with women in bright saris sitting side saddle, taxis filled to the brim with oversized men.","We get there. It's dark and the little light sends long shadows over the people sitting on the dusty pavement and the children selling padlocks and chains for your luggage, although they are really selling paranoia. We stock up on snacks, in the aircraft hanger of the station waiting room, complete with rooms for women, enquiries, toilets, police and everything you could want. People sit in the middle of the space on blankets with there goods covered up with rugs.","We head to our platform and walk down the edge of the dusty blue train. The economical class is a dark carriage with bars, an old women freaks me out as she appears out of the dark as we walk past. We soon find our beds although we are not all together which sucks, but on the whole the train journey was good and we eat the cooked dinner on the train, although Claire didn't like the Thai. I did and think so did Karl.","We lent our India book to a man on the train and he returned the favour by helping us negotiate a taxi to the town of Erotic temples  Khajuraho. We get to the Zen hotel and have a few beers, some crap food and soon we are sleeping. Next day we spend most of it looking around the wonders of the Hindu temples and then drinking and eating in a tree house. Then it's a tiger safari and on to Varanasi but you have to wait until next time for that....."],

        "description": ["The world never looks good at 5am, but the cold air as we bump around in the back of a jeep to Panna National Park wakes us up somewhat.  We collect a guide who does an excellent job of pointing to things that are 'natural' and almost immediately spot a family of peacocks, followed by monkeys (both cheeky and non-cheek varieties), antelope, samba, spotted deer and a solitary crocodile.  The tiger hunt was less of a success though, so the spot in front of the fire will have to remain bare a little longer.  Such an early start requires an lot of recuperation, (as does a lot of suspect curry), so it was back to the hotel to take it easy and wait for the journey to Varanasi where it required an impressive 8 people to helps us carry our own bags to the car.","Excuse please, duck.","Sorry?","Down, down, now please.","So we put our heads between our legs and prepare to kiss our wallets goodbye.  And that's how we passed thorough most of the wild west style towns along the way.  It's strange how a pleasant night drive through the country side can turn more than a little bit sinister when the driver tells you you're in 'very dangerous area'.","You mean tigers?","No.","Snakes?","No, criminal.  They stop car, they take moneys, they kill.","Lovely, thanks.","His previously smooth driving became a lot more urgent and erratic as he sped down the tiny road, hardly slowing as he dived into the dirt to avoid the occasional oncoming truck.  It clearly wasn't something he told the dumb tourists just for entertainment.  What few motorcyclists there are in the area carry rifles for protection.  Indian ingenuity must have been at it's peek when some genius decided the best material for a railway crossing was gravel, and we immediately got stuck on the tracks.  Spinning the wheels only dug us in deeper & in the cloud covered night we could only see about 50 meters down the track on either side.  The driver was clearly starting to panic so we  jumped out to push.  It's amazing how much the threat of bandits and high speeds trains works to concentrate the mind & we were out of the track & back in the car within seconds. We completed the two hour journey in a hectic hour and a quarter.  We looked at each other as we grabbed ouR bags from the roof & agreed that it was all 'Fucking cool!' I don't think the driver was looking forward to the journey back though.","Mohaba train station is everything a good frontier station should be.  Crumbling, chaotic and populated by wild looking people from surrounding villages and beyond.  Almost every available space on the ground was occupied by sleeping bodies, and those still awake stood and stared as the European tourists  tried their best to act casual.  Combined with the journey there, it seemed a very sinister place to us.  We found a second class waiting room to hide in where a travelling preacher asked after our everlasting souls.  He also explained that the danger in the area was due to the fact that the police in the Indian states generally don't cooperate, and so criminals on the run often cross the border into the neighbouring state to avoid the police Dukes of Hazzard style.   A gruff two star general appeared and barked that we put our bags standing in the corner and ordered that we were not to sleep.  'Very dangerous here' he said, prodding the other sleepers who remained awake for as long as it took him to leave & then turned over and went back to sleep.  We got the impression that he's not used to polite conversation.  When the huge train arrived about two hours later there was a mild panic was we ran up and down the platform trying to find our carriage before the train took off again.  Giving up we clambered up into the nearest door only to find it was our carriage.  We climbed into our berths, and  were asleep within seconds (except for Mick who has some essential Linux reading to do first).","The touts in Varanasi don't waste much time, and our feet had barely hit the platform the next morning when one attached himself to us.  He invited himself into our taxi but jumped out a few minutes later, clearly not pleased to discover we'd already booked a hotel and there wasn't gong to be any commission in it for him.  The streets of this city seem even more chaotic than the average Indian city and our hassle gauges were already well into the red when we detached ourselves from the limpet-like, driver (I show you better hotel) and walked into the Palace on the Ganges hotel.  After some confusion it transpires that we actually have a booking in the Palace on the River hotel a few kilometres away.  The easiest way to get there we're told, is by boat.  So after another full frontal assault from the taxi driver who's still waiting outside we brace ourselves and begin the haggling with the red-eyed bettle chewing man on the river bank.  Once we make the deal it's all red-toothed smiles and our boat pulls up beside a group of women washing and wailing in the Ganges.  The boatman tells us they're a funeral party.  They apply a pink paint to themselves during the funeral ceremony and wash it off 10 days later.","We climb aboard and suddenly the spirit of the river seems to hit us and what was a stressful, messy affair becomes a slow and tranquil journey upstream.  The chaos of the city is nowhere to be seen on the Ganges as people wash, pray, talk and laugh on the steps or ghats that lead down to the water.  After about twenty minutes of rowing we pull in along some women washing clothes and climb the steps to the hotel.  We're greeted by garlands of roses and cool drinks before being shown to our rooms and then heading straight to the restaurant on the top floor for good food and great views of the river, the town and the monkeys leaping along the rooftops, jumping through windows and stealing bread.  Having first expected nothing but the worst from this city we easily decide to spend three nights here.","In the evening we make our way through the narrow and incredibly atmospheric backstreets and into the madness of the modern streets in search of some much deserved alcohol. A small plump man we privately christen Pabaker (a character from the novel Shantaram) shows us to a dark subterranean cage where we restock and then sweet talks us into visiting his silk factory around the corner.  Inside we sit cross-legged as Pabaker and his brother unfurl with a flourish, sheet upon sheet of embroidered silk.  We leave an hour later weighed down by feather-light silks and fight through the craziness back to our sanctuary.","Karl's Pictures can be found here.... "],

        "description": ["So we left the silky man who Karl failed to mention also played Indian drums at techno parties in Goa so it was only right that he knew where to buy Hashish, MDMA and last but not least Opium we assured him that we were more than happy with just the rum. So we retired to our room for the night to get completely legless.","We are slow to get up but we manage to drag our banging heads to a German bakery. We sit cross legged on the mattress provided and we relax until we spot"," a mouse then another and another scurrying over the beds near by but somewhat hardened from the rat experience and too hung over to care we took into our crappy breakfast and morning paper. The Times of Indian tells of a gang that held 17 people to sell there blood and 10 year old girl getting burnt to death by 10 year old boys... erm nice.","Finally more together we take an early evening stroll along the Ghats until we come to the funeral Ghat. We are assured that travellers are welcome as long as we refrain from taking photos. We approach the funeral fire somewhat apprehensively but we are soon greeted by a local man who ushers us closer to the fires and explains the intricacies of the ceremony. The man runs a house for those older people that come to Varansi before to die. It is believed that if they are cremated next to the Ganges then they will go straight to Heaven rather than being reincarnated. He leads us to a position that is directly in front of a roaring cremation and a platform of wood where body is about to be put in place for the beginning of the ceremony.","The body is first placed in the Ganges on a bamboo stretcher to be cleansed then the vibrant cloth that covers the body are removed one by one. The body is then placed by on top of the wood by male family members the head faces heaven and the feet toward the water. The eldest son has completely shaved his body apart from on small piece of hair on the back of his head. He then circles the fire five times to represent the elements and then sets fire to the wood. When only embers remain the eldest son fills"," a clay pot from the Ganges and put the fire out . With his back toward the fire he throws the pot over his head so it smashes and he walks away not looking back. This is to represent the breaking of emotional ties to this world allowing the soul to pass safely to heaven. Any bone left over are then collected and thrown into the Ganges. Any family member that starts to cry must leave the ceremony as this also impedes the souls safe passage. The ceremony is incredibly respectful and we are all deeply moved by the experience.","This is a very industrious process with at least 10 going off in different stages when we where there. The wood used is brought in for its burning properties from far a way and is very expensive. There are from 100 to 200 a day and people from all over the world. Apparently a French bloke got burnt there last week.","Very hot and a little sprinkled in ash we decide to take a boat ride at sun set and to witness the Puja from the calmness of the Ganges. We slip through the velvety water and although the water is littered with many tourists maintains it dignity and serenity. We all light candles on a bed of flowers, think of our families happiness and heath and release them.","We rise at 5.30 am and after checking in with each other about our morning toilet motions and take to the water for a truly glorious sun rise. As we return to our Ghat we see a large object floating in the water. As we get closer we realise that it strangely resembles a body. Oh yes it is a body. Karl gently nudges the boats man narrowly missing a full on collision with Floating Freddy as Karl respectfully refers to him. We soon notice that are three crows on his back that are kindly assisting Floating Freddy to loose those extra pounds. After spending a few hours in a small hot office trying to arrange our exit from Varanasi we have a couple of beers served in silver goblets and coffee pots and then to bed.","Another early start and we are off to the train station for the usual panicky faff before catching the train. We are all in separate carbines and discover the express train"," will take seven hours longer then we were told by the tour agent that ripped us off. I soon retire to my bed that I affectionately refer to as the refrigerated coffin. Nice."],

        "description": ["The train chugged along, the bloke opposite me scowled (perhaps because we gave away his sheets when we thought he'd left) and bought anything that was on offer. Claire and I took it in turns to finish of  Shantaram: 20 pages left each, then 10, then 3 and done. Book-less!","We get to Japiur which we soon realise is the town where the taxi drivers do not know where to go. After much bartering, walking off and getting a better price, we get into the taxi. Although, these young lads, do not have a clue where they are going. We eventually tell them to take us back to the train station, we get our stuff out of the boot, walk off and pay them nowt.","Karl gets out his GPS things and we walk. Bare in mind this is two in the morning and there are people asleep in their rickshaws, under the overpass and we are all bagged up. Some roads have long shadows and don't look too friendly. We sit down outside a hotel and this bloke comes up to us, before we know it he has sorted a taxi whom knows our hotel and we are speeding our way to the Generals Retreat. Great place. Ran by the dead general's family. Regiment pictures on the wall, spotlessly clean and tasteful  décor. We hit the clean sheets.","Next day we have a late breakfast and plan to book a trip to Agra and the Taj Mahal. This was going to involve taxi's to travel agents, sitting around in a hot room and trying to work out the best train to take for a day trip. This was all not needed as we just got our hotel to book us a taxi all the way there and back. By far the best solution. Four hours there and four hours back, then we'll escape this big city to enjoy the Holi festival in small town  Bundi.","So we take a quick look around the walled city until Karl's stomach has us running up and down the street looking for a café or something with a toilet. Taxi! Hotel! Of course they don't know the way, but we do and Karl's cramping over. We make it in time.","Move rooms faff and we go out to eat at an Italian restaurant (owned by the same people who have one in  Khajuraho). Strange set up though: You have to walk through what's like concrete tunnels and stairs, not dissimilar to a car park. Then take the quasi freight lift to the roof top, past the huge satellite dishes and then you can enjoy a beer in a tea pot. ( special tea or pop).","Next morning we wake early and drive to Agra, stopping off on the way to see a huge mosque. The touts here are on speed, or something like and soon we are telling them lies about origins, what our names are or if we can speak English.","The mosque is quiet huge though and Claire managed not to offend strict Muslims by pointing the souls of her feet at Mecca whilst taking a picture of the ceiling. Although she did do this in the mosque at Taj Mahal. Karl also offended someone by taking a picture of turtles in the secret lake and not the  washing Ghat. Looks like it's only me going to heaven.","We get there and take a horse and cart from the car park outside the no car zone. Touts are crazy and will sell you anything from hand print kits to their very important guide service. After much arsing around, money exchanging hands, putting bags and a dangerous copy of the lonely planet in the cloak room, we walk into the entrance area.  Wow.","Made for his dead wife (it is a grave) and meant to be a copy of heaven. He didn't get to enjoy it though, as he and his concubines where locked up in the red fort after a family betrayal and spending a fortune making the Taj Mahal, with the best gems, marble and craftsmen from 1000's of miles around. However, in the red fort he could see the Taj Mahal through a window and there he died of an aphrodisiac overdose. His corpse was secretly shipped over to lie forever with his love of his life and favourite wife.","It was a very hot day, but we all felt good and soon got dozy in the taxi on the way back through the dust storms. The next day we have a random trip through some of the sights of Japiur. Including in the city palace, these huge silver 900n gallon jugs (made of coins) for transporting Ganges water to England. Soon its back to the hotel and the last night before a huge confusion at the bus station going back and forth with heavy bags until we are on our way to Bundi. The bonfires at the sides of the road where just getting lit as we left. This is the first part of the Holi festival..."],

It's night, the bus station is empty. The Indian women Claire had met on the bus is standing there with her two brothers, we pick up our bags and walk around the corner to get a tuk-tuk. Off we speed into the night dodging fires on the way until we reach our hostel. We get settled and sleep after a bottle of rum.","The morning brings noises from the street. I look out of the window and its happening. Any person on the street is covered in dye. The streets and everyone in sight is covered in rainbows of colour. I have a quick peek out the door and even in the hall of the hostel I see people with dye on them. Unavoidable.","We soon get up and go down stairs where the people who run the hostel wish us happy Holi and place dye on our faces and hair. We re-group and head out in search of food. Karl forgets his GPS and goes back for it, in the meantime me and Claire get covered by every group or motorbike that goes by. No water pistols here, like we've seen for sale in every other town. They come up and place the dye on you. Karl joins us and we have a quick wander until some over excited boy gets out of control with Claire so we head back to the hostel and watch the monkeys and people from the window looking over the street.  By about three o'clock the excitement has dyed out and we go about the lengthy task of washing away the festival of colour.","With Holi over the next day we walk around in the heat and have look at the ruins of Bundi. We try and get bus tickets and generally get lost. After returning to the hostel to cool down before our walk to the walls at sunset.","Before you get to the city wall, a man approaches you and offers to loan you a stick for 5rp for protection against the more aggressive monkeys up the hill side. We don't get one, but we all watch the monkeys carefully as we climb.","Before we know it we are leaving the dusty blue buildings of Bundi and heading to Pushkar. This is on a regular bus and people are sitting on top of other people and all is hot and creaking. We get to Ajmer and  get a taxi with Ed a young bloke we met on the bus.","In Pushkar there are no eggs, meat, kissing or Alcohol, although there seems to be an abundance of neo hippies and freely available Bhang Lassis ( yoghurt drink containing hashish) for purely spiritual purposes you understand. There are also a lot of Israeli shops and people although the reason for this remains unknown.","As Pushka has the only Temple dedicated to Brahma Karl and I (Claire) venture inside. We are told that we have to take a flower offering and so we do and we are immediately accompanied by a not wanted or needed guide. The temple fails to impress but non the less we are encouraged to give our flowers to the priest on duty. The small somewhat grumpy man with NHS glasses swiftly snatches the flowers from us, messes them around in a bowl with the other gifts from the hundreds of people gathered and gives you back a pick and mix selection of flowers and mints that you are supposed to release into the Ghat.","Karl and I empty the bundle at the Gandi Ghat (where his ashes where thrown), The large fishes gasping for air are more than interested in the mints. At breakfast we meet a very friendly and fast moving tortuous called Qechein who begs at the breakfast tables.","As we have time to kill before we catch the midnight bus we decide to catch a camel for a two hour ride to watch the sun set. It was a lovely experience for me as I refused to have a man at the back of me so the two boys had the guides with them , Mick's being the most talkative of the two and constantly whispering in Hindi that was slightly unnerving for Mick.","On the way back we stopped to have Chi from a lovely village family who are very entertained by us. Especially by me holding their baby and the colour of my hair. Thankful for the rest we head off at a fast trot down the dark roads full of passing lorries. Great but I would strongly advise any female planning to gallop off into the sun set on a camel to wear some supportive underwear.","The midnight bus finally arrives at 1.30am. We have to move out people that are sleeping in our cabin and as we pull away it becomes painfully apparent that the bus has little if no suspension. Bouncing up out of bunks every now and again with a good understanding of every crack in the road.","We somehow reach octopussy land and the city of Udipur on schedule. We eat at the all you can eat thali restaurant (featured on Anthony Bourdain No Reservations  - S02E07 - India Rajasthan). This is where Karl must leave us to return to Amsterdam and we must plan Thailand. Five days and we also will be gone....."],

        "description": ["It was not so much jet lag, but the fact that we had an early flight making us stay up all night that made us dizzy. The flight itself was only 3 and half hours and we were in a spotless airport, I wouldn't normally mention this but it sticks out after India. The roads where less congested and there wasn't a barrage of car horns.","The area we are in is tourist area. Thousands of backpacking youths from all over. It's ok though. The food, beer and accommodation is good and cheap. 13 quid for an expensive double room a night. So I go out and buy my third pair of sun glasses and third pair of flip flops.","We spend a day walking across town along the huge boulevards to look at the reclining Buddha, swim in the roof top pool and watching a small French boy burst into tears after falling in the beautiful carp pool. The touts here have nothing on Indian touts and seem to wash over us. The street food here looks good and clean, seems you can get everything, from eggs on a stick to fried insects (which the local paper says aren't very good for you  high in .histamines). The tuk-tuk drivers have a tendency to rip you off and you just can't trust the tour agents. Also in the tourist area there some dubious second-hand/stolen backpackers shoes, bags etc. Not found a book to match Shantram, although there are several about the Bangkok Hilton  the local jail. There also a huge weekend market we went to by the easy and cheap tube.","We are liking Bangkok or officially known as Krungthep mahanakhon amonratanakosin mahintara ayuthaya mahadilok popnopparat ratchathani burirom udomratchaniwet mahasathan amonpiman avatansathit sakkathattiya witsanukamprasit. Although we can't wait to see the rest of Thailand. After finding out that the buses are faster and cheaper than the trains here, we book a train. A second class sleeper to Chiang Mai. Might do a bit of trekking around the hills there, might go to a village called Pai for the water festival (although water pistols sales are 30% down on last year). Anyway our vague plan is to mess around in north Thailand for a bit, cut across to Laos, into Cambodia and then back to Thailand beachy south region. From there we make our way through Borneo, Singapore maybe, but we should end up in Bali by June. Also might visit Kuala Lumpur as I like the name.","Thanks to Judy, Lisa, Rachel and  for all your Thailand advice."],

        "description": ["A quick taxi to the wonderful Bangkok train station, its hard not to make comparisons with India. Family's on blankets on the clean floor eating Thai food. Big pictures of the Thai royal family which are everywhere in Bangkok and the rest of Thailand so far. Thailand's flag is also ubiquitous.","We hump our bags on the train, stow them next to our beds and sit down. We miss out on the Thai train food as we've eaten and even turn down a beer. Four men, all in uniform and with guns come and check our tickets. The train starts off after a few false starts. Claire wins the counting cockroach competition and the next thing we know we are asking a man in a face mask to make up our beds and we sleep. We arrive in  Chiang Mai and get a tuk-tuk to our hostel. Everything seems to be gearing up for the Thai new year water festival.","The next few days we brave the heat and look around the great city. We go to a huge night market, we where see some great artists, wooden handy crafts and lots of plastic crap.  The wooden handy crafts are really quiet good and we would have got the lot but we have to travel. We try some wonderful tofu stir fries and buy our water weapons.","We wake on the fateful day, wrap our wallet in a plastic bag, load our guns, bottle extra ammo and head on our. We dodge through the back streets, getting ambushed and ambushing, if only we had mike off spaced with us. The enemy is around every corner, hidden and waiting to pounce, we spot one cheeky kid hid in a bucket of water, Slowly we are getting drenched, its a great laugh and all done with good humour.","Eventually I learn how to use my gun properly and we can dish out some payback. We head for the main Wat (temple) where the whole water thing originated from. This is a more sombre affair and has a little market with a bigger one down the road. We head out back into the battlefield, head towards the main gate of the wall city and the river. This is where all the action is taking place.","Every hundred yard in front of the shops there is a hose pipe into a huge drum. People bucket the water on to passing Jeeps which have there own water drums and bucket back at them. Everyone gets wet. I'm quiet amazed the motorbikes and scooters don't slip and crash as the road turns into a river.","The best weapon is the bucket on a string, which can be lowered into the river and dump on the next victim. We spot a dead fish in the river, so not so sure how clean it is, but this stops noone. The best ammo is ice water. We see some huge blocks of ice knocking around and if you get hit with ice water, you know about it.","There's food stalls and everyone looks like they are having a good time. Alcohol and smoking is banned with a huge fine and prison time and all age are battling it out, some in costume, some masked, all wet.","We are soaked to the skin and make a b-line for the ms beautiful women with umbrella on bicycle competition which is amongst a bunch of completions that is going on over the festival.","As cameras and water don;t mix we didn't bring our camera out, although we did risk Claire's camera phone. But I'm sure there will be a load of photos on flickr, etc. Here's a few from the bbc. ","The thing is about the water festival is that it goes on for four or five days, so it makes leaving the town with all your luggage a bit difficult. We manage to do it a dawn tuk-tuk to the bus station. We get a packed mini bus (that we reckon is the same van we had in NZ) and we head out for the motion sickness trip to the town of Pai. The roads also are very NZ like windy up and down and the forest look like cloud forest of Ecuador.","We make it to Pai and head to the hills, where we book into a wonderful hostel of teak huts surrounding a man made lake and swimming lake. It's great. The festival is going here also, so when we walk into town over the rickety bamboo bridge we have to be tooled up.","We failed to get on a cooking course in Chiang Mai and we might fail to get on one here also as time is running out, We have to get to Cambodia before the rainy season kicks in and we have to see Loas first. Not sure what border crossing we should do: dodgy boat crossing in the north or friendship bridge in the middle.... Ermm... We will see."],

        "description": ["We have to say goodbye to Phats (our giant gecko that befriended and protected us during our stay) and  goodbye to Pai just as it appears to be waking up from the water festival days, oh well. We decide to pop back to Chaing Mai for one night.","Our mini bus has a French man in his 50s who was smoking a spliff and drinking whisky at 10 am and continued to do so throughout the journey. His advice to us was don't do the boat journey to Laos its terrible, its full of drunken people.","An early rise and a tuk-tuk to the bus station. Full and ordered as normal. The national anthem comes on and we all have to stand except a couple of monks which carry on sitting and looking cool in their orange robes. We get on the bus to the boarder. An easy 5 hour air conditioned but bad suspension journey. There we spend the night on the Thai boarder with a view over the mighty Makong river and the other side  Laos, which used to be Loa until the French colonials put a silent s on.","After a night of big insects and broken English, we have another early start, horrid breakfast and the ferry to Laos. It takes at the most a five minute boat ride on a motorised canoe. Of course there is the usual crossing the boarder faff. We have to get a photo taken, we have to change Bhat to American Dollars to pay for the visa, then last minute we have to find two more dollars as its Saturday and therefore overtime. Luckily we have three dollars left over from south America Hurrah! Our passports then disappear and we are left hanging around with the crowd until their randomly handed out.","We soon discover that the speed boat or the slow two day long boat are the only real options to get to Luang Prabang, We decide on the long boat as the speed boats are notoriously dangerous and require you to wear crash helmets. Tickets are purchased and we are loaded on to a van cattle style. Of course there is not enough room, so Mick and I stand up and holding on tight as we swing around on the back of the truck.","There she is, our transport for the next two days. Not as bad as we thought, we smiled at each other and buy cushions for our delicate gluteus-maximumus as we have seen every one else clutching theirs. On the boat and we are thankful that we made the purchase. The benches are hard and upright and looked as if they had been nailed together by a demented two year old. Some people are catapulted off if their fellow bencher gets up too quickly, but it provides us with entertainment as we begin our so called six our journey.","The boat trip is uncomfortable but also wonderful. There's bunch of Loas on board, including young monks in their bright orange and shaven heads, lady boys in their over the top make up and a ton of jewellery. The rest are tourist from all over, a few rowdy search and annoy women. One Belguim, one American and a bottle of whiskey. Also an older Akha guy with a guitar and mouthorgan, who plays a few songs. One apparent love song made a few of the young Loas cry.","We meet a bunch of people, but mostly keep quiet and take in the sights and the breeze from the side of the boat. When ever the boat stops the heat comes in. White sacks are loaded on and off. People get off at their villages and on we go. Often we see children playing in the river, back-flipping into the water and waving from the banks. I think we are going to like Loas.","At one point the tension of the boat rises as more sacks come on, more crates of Loas beer and we feel too full. As we start discussing rescue techniques we hunch down the river. Just before sunset the boat pulls into Pak Beng, a cool village bastardised by tourism.","It doesn't matter if you have a fan in your room or not at 10:30pm the power is cut and the village sleeps. Surprising number of children playing with plastic guns, although what do we know. We do know that America dropped tons of land mines on Loas every day for two years with out declaring war. Apparently we shouldn't talk about that.","The next day, we go down the river again past the huge jagged black rocks that must be covered in the wet session and when the river rises. Often the matriarch comes out and shouts at the passengers to get off the side of the boats as we are about to hit some white water as the river narrows. All said and done, we get there and even though it's good to get off the boat, it was a great ride, although boring at times. Although getting bored sometimes helps you to notice stuff."],

        "description": ["Stepping off the boat at sunset we hang around in the crowd as they bring out our bags from underneath the floor borders of the boat. We march up the hill to the tuk tuk gathering. With a hostel address in mind we hump our stuff on to the tuk tuk. He drives us around the city and to our hostel which is about 5 minutes from where we left, no wonder he wanted paying up front. Oh well we have millions of kip in our pockets. Kip has got to be the most annoying currency we have come across, often having two numbers on the notes and the exchange rate to pounds is something dumb like 17200 to a pound. Just to make it more confusing Laos also trade in dollars and Baht as well as kip. Often we have found our selves at the point of sale dripping with sweat nervously trying to make sense of the money. This doesn't matter though as the Loas people are wonderful. Even the language seems homely - hello sounds like Zebadie (Sabai dee) - a magic roundabout of tropical heat and old French buildings.","It feels like we have been on the move for ever and we are glad of some stillness. We watch the sunset turn the sky red and tuck into some great tofu sir fry in the cheapest river side restaurant. The bugs are out in force but so are the lizards.","The next day we explore this great town followed by a massage and some great nosh. Life feels good, we drink in the night.","We wake and check into a cheaper hotel and then hire a tuk tuk for the day to take us to the waterfalls. It takes about an hour to get their, we pick up some old village women on the way and drop them off again. We pass a pair of working village elephants, wet muddy water buffalo and get to the park.","It seems like there is some heavy logging going off here as the apparent woodpeckers make a noise not unlike a circler saw. We head into the park and first see the moon beers who's lives have been saved in this sanctuary. As is an apparent tiger, who is no where to be seen. I think all tigers are invisible to us. Anyway on to the waterfalls and wow, they are idealic, The water crashes down into a bunch of turquoise swimming pool dotted up the jungle hill side.","The game is to find the best pool to swim in. We have inside knowledge that it's best to go up the left path. Soon we are sweating like crazy and just getting fed up of trying to find the ideal pool. We head back down to the assigned swimming area and dive in. Freezing cold water, but great all the same, even the little fish nibbling at your legs don't bother us, everyone seems to be having fun.","We dry off and go and see the bears again before returning home with our smiling tuk tuk driver. That night we meet up with a bloke from Leeds, his VJ partner, an Irish women and English women for a big night out. Drunken tuk tuks all over town ending up in weird Laos club with a band playing to an empty dance floor and then on to the bowling alley, the only place in town that breaks the curfew. The curfew starts at midnight, we were banging on our hotel door at 3am  opps. Great night, have few details."],

The view over Lang pan bang are certainly worth it and"," a small crowed gathers to share the view."," Whilst at the Wat we see a giant moth incredibly huge . Its wing span must have been the best part of a foot.","Off to the nightmarket where Mick manages to stay calm as I mozzie amongst the lanes of textiles and jewellery. We find a wonderful stall to eat, a vegetarian Laos buffet , you fill your plate to the brim with a variety of local dishes that cost 5000 kip (that's 29p to you and me).","Later as we are out enjoying Laos Beer the sky lights up and the heavens open and we are guided into the internet café. The entertainment is provided by the five lizards devouring the local huge flying ants. As the rain dies down the ants come out in force, hundreds of the things everywhere. When we get back to our guest house the ants are trying to take over but the locals are running around catching them and throwing them into large bowls where they meet their watery death. The owner of the gust house informs me that you can buy the ants fried at the local market and they taste a little like coconut, yum.","Again we have another lazy morning and we simply wake up and wander the streets everywhere we go there are abundance of local people sleeping as they are working. I love Laos."," On the way back to the guest house we stumble across a stall where you can buy a shot of the local brew from huge glass jars, namely whisky with pickled cobras in it. Even me and Mick wont drink that particular beverage."],

Endless green rolling mountains. Nine hours later, after much dozing, taking pictures out the window and stopping off for complimentary gruel where we decide to skip the battered chicken heads and we arrive in the Capital. We jump in a sawngthaew, which is like tuk tuk van thing with two seats opposite each other, managing to avoid treading on the five or so chickens squeezed into a weaved cage.","After finding a superb hotel we kick back. This city is desolate and a bit grim. Yes there is an arc de triumph and huge boulevards, but it just all seems a bit lacking. There's a huge aerobic session that pumps out bad music before sunset near the almost dry river. Also there is Laos icon: The very gold Pha That Luang, but the heat slows everything down and we just want to leave.","We are currently stuck in a planning quagmire of visa's, buses and planes.

        "description": ["We find the sticky fingers, full moon café and suddenly Vientiane seems better, we decide just to get our visa on the border and book a trip to Si Phan Don. We leave the luxury of our hotel and head out to Paske by bus. The sleeper bus was a tight squeeze with no curtains but a strange super hero type film featuring a Hilda Ogdan type hero who had a super scream and a cigarette constantly hanging out the corner of her mouth. Time for sleep but we seemed to have the only non stop speaker blearing out Laos popular music throughout the night Lucky us !"," Once there we get a bus to the shore to get a boat to Don Khong, We are joined by a young English couple, that we have been bumping into along the way. Louisa is an 18 year old rada applicant whom seems to be very well travelled. Ross is a 20 year old ministry house DJ doing business and finance. We have a chin wag and some very good Pad Thai and steamed fish. The next day they move on to the next islands and we decide to hire cycles.","The rain hit hard all night. Is this the start of the rainy season? I hope not, Cambodia is not meant to work not so well once the rain falls. In fact, Cambodia is meant to look like a big puddle from the air once rainy season is in full affect. We watch the water bucket down whilst munching our eggs and bread breakfast. All this water puts our plan of cycling around the island to rest. It's so much cooler today, we sit around and read.","Then the rain pitiers out, we grab a pair of cycles and head north. Past small villages with a hundred Sabaidee, past sleepy dogs, past multiple schools, some wats all on the paved road. The president was brought up here and he arranged for the road. Onwards we go past water buffaloes and waving kids, stopping to regain blood in our behinds and once to fix a fallen chain. The weather says fair, not hot and not raining, after 3 hours and 32KM we are back at base after circling the island. Time for a beer and a sit. We think we make arrangements to get a motorised canoe the next day. Then pop down the road and over the wooden bridge for some snap. On our return we meet an Canadian guy, who is recently married and an expectant farther. Although his wife is currently working on her masters in Chang Mai. He has lived in Laos for seven years and can speak Lao. In fact his wife is Lao.","We wave good bye to Don Khong and head up the Mekong to Don Det. On the boat are also Canadian Sharon and Kiwi Jessica. We pull up on the beach in full sun, try not to fall in the river as we hulk our bags on to our back and go off hostel searching. There are two sides of the island  sunset boulevard and sun rise strip. We have been told that sunset is cooler and as there is limited electricity (and fans) here, we head for the sunset side.","Bear and Sharon head off heroically looking for a suitable bed, Jessica and I guard the bags. They know each other as they have both been teaching together in South Korea. Apparently there's a bunch of cash to be had there, also there's a weird key system for renting a flat. You give the landlord a great lump of cash as deposit and then pay no rent. Any damages comes out of the key money and the landlord invest the money to make a profit out of you living there. Strange! Although Sharon had the surprise that her landlord told her one day that they where going to knock the house down next week.","Bear returns and we find a hut with bathroom (of sorts). It's very basic (read dive), but has piglets near by and a veranda to drink whiskey on. We cycle to the other island Don Khon and look at some much better guest house that we decide not to stay in. Back over the abandon French railway bridge and back to base all worn out by the sun. Although a great day of watching kids playing and saying hello and water buffaloes walling in the river. After a good meal served by a cute Laos girl who Claire wants to steal, the sun sets.","It was a night of bugs and drugs. The drugs being local whiskey and beer. The bugs being every where a vast storm of them, that turned my arm into a Mumbia road for bugs, as I desperately tried to take us out of pitch black by lighting a candle. The bugs then fly around the flame at immense speed often dying in the wax. In the morning the wax bug corpse structure is was enough to turn your stomach."," The lightening every now and again wakes up the sky and we listen to Jessica's flight of the concords ipod music and try to avoid the huge praying mantas in the toilet.","The next day we get cycles again and head down the waterfalls we missed the day before. We watch the waterfalls do there thing for a bit and then follow the curious beach signs. It's a bit like junior kick start challenge: Over tree stumps, through puddles, past rocks."," Then we are there on the sand and a little swimming area near the shore. There are also signs saying people have died here.","After cycling back that night the rain falls like hell, which forces us into the safety of our mossy net in the hut. We have booked the trip to Cambodia's Phnom Penn and away from the land where they use Dutch chickens as currency and have no cushions or even mattresses sometimes...."],

More people show up and soon we are lugging our stuff down the mud road to the waters edge and on to a motorised canoe. We are about to spend all day with these people, not the best prospects. A pleasent enough sail to the main land and bundle ourselves in to a mini bus, to go get our exit stamp and then our Cambodian visa. It's all hot and slow, plenty of forms to fill in, sweating and photographs. Then we are off into Cambodia with the dead Kennedys song playing in my head.","We stop off again, unload and wait for the big bus to take us to the capital. The bus is terrible and turns up when our cafe food does. The pressure is eased by a bloke from Mexico and his Argentinian friend playing and singing on their acoustic guitars. I appreciate their talent but don't like the songs. The road is mostly paved, everyone's luggage is packed along the isle of the bus and covered with planks of wood that is used as the floor. We have a slight bumpy unpaved dry mud detour but make it back on the road before the rain buckets down and good job too. The tyre underneath the bus did go pop though and it is also placed on the already overcrowded bus. We arrive well into the night and in the fuss of getting off the bus, we forget the Bolivian hat. This is a sad state of affairs as we've had it all along the trip.","It's close to 11pm on a Saturday night, we check a few hostels out, but we are just tired and want a bed. We end up in a place that looks over the lake covered in greenery. A couple are watching Juno and we join in. Swig a beer. We soon find out that anything is available on the menu here: including opiates and all sorts. Two of the staff spend most of the time lying down and throwing up. Ugly, messed up Cambodia. Another of the staff blames 1975 for it, although he was too young to be there for the ugly event himself, he leans on the fact that it's inheritable.","The next day we get our stuff together, past the stoners watching a film and check out. We then check into Simon 2, a much better place where we are able to take our first bath in months, wonderful . It's called Simon 2 after the owners son and even though, the sign depicts a picture of a brown kiwi, he's not from NZ he's from Maastricht. This is all getting too strange. This year is getting on the side of too much for him, 8 years ago there where only 20 backpackers but now there's too many. This used to be the seedy part of town, there were certain alleys you didn't go down but now it's much better. Still there's an advert in every room to go see the killing fields or cock-fight or shoot a machine gun. Hard drugs are offered just out side the door of the hostel and happy pizzas or paranoid pizzas as we call them are available in all restaurants, but everything seems safe and friendly enough. This city doesn't seem so poor, it does have echo's of India, random traffic without so many beeps.","We have a day off and go down the Russian market and buy random stuff. Here from the 100's of stalls, you can get motorcycle parts, food, pirate DVD all under one hot tin roof. The next day we intend to see the genocide stuff at the killing fields and S21 (interrogation house) . As you will not be able to imagine, it's really disturbing stuff. Feels weird taking photographs but it's here to be remembered. With that done we leave the city for the town that has the icon of Cambodia  Siem Reap."],

        "description": ["After a six hour not so painful bus journey, apart from a film that the locals found hilarious which involved a down trodden husband sneering off to the Karaoke barrow only to be found out by his wife to be beaten by a stick, anyway we get to Siem Reap.","We make a pathetic attempt to walk to town in the heat, we decide to take it easy. Two young Irish guys try and do the same as it gets dark but they soon return not too far behind scared away by the local working girls offering the local loving menu when they were not hungry.","Waking up is never easy but we sit for breakfast around noon. It soon becomes apparent that the three blokes opposite a mixture of northerners and Irish are completely wasted and are discussing violence quite loudly. The Irish young man produces a bottle of whisky with a cobra in it and offers it to all in the vicinity. We decide not to take his generous offer. As they all slink off upstairs to continue their session the eldest one makes a beeline for our table. We manage to subdue the situation before the staff lead him away whilst explaining that they had all been up all night.","A day of rest but we get to the local market that feels like a ghost town so we crawl back in the oppressive mid day sun. for our evening meal we eat at Dead Fish. A truly bizarre establishment. It resembles a warehouse with many mezzanine levels, precariously held up by slim lengths of cable with a pulley system that links it to the kitchen and bar. As we browse the menu we gain some insight into this weird place. They have mirrors everywhere for the staff to check their make-up, a number of clocks that all tell the wrong time as they don't want to know, they have ducks to eat all the insects and crocodiles because they tried to build"," a crocodile farm but they decided that they actually liked crocodiles so they keep them in a pen at the restaurant, of course."," As I headed to the loo there it was the crocodile pen containing at least four of the not so little monsters. I think that the pen was quite small, although it disappears into the darkness beneath the wooden floorboards, however at least they are safe for the meantime unlike the ducks who seen to have gone from the pond but duck does appear on the menu. Not only duck but pig cheek with skin, pig trotters, cows heart and various stir fried bugs. Yum.","At eight we jump in a tuck tuck and we are flying down the streets towards the legendary Angkor Watt.","Its the largest religious building in the world dedicated to Vishnu. The king apparently picked up a few ideas from the Indian sailors who got stranded in Cambodia waiting for the whether system to change direction. The architecture is outstanding and every square millimetre is covered in intricate carvings.","The main carving depicts the story of gods and demons playing tug of war with a snake until the ocean of milk is churned up until they are able to extract the elixir of immortality.","On to Bayon where the gently smiling faces look down from every possible angle. People report that it feels eerie but I find it strangely cosy. Last but not least we head to Ta Prohm. The jungle was originally cleared to build the hundreds of temples but here the jungle has reclaimed its land and the roots of magnificent old trees have established there roots through every crack in the brickwork and they smother the buildings squeezing them into rubble. Its a truly magical fairytale place, one not so far from a set of Pans Labyrinth. This obviously is my favourite. Power to the trees."],

There are rumours that Thai airlines bribe people to make the road bad.","We see the bus we could have got on the way and it looked hot and miserable. The taxi gets to the border in 4 hours, the bus takes 10 hours plus. So by midday we step out the taxi on a dusty traffic island"," and queue up to get our exit stamp in the weird messed up casino border town."," Then we walk over the border and fill out more forms to get a new Thai visa. On to the back of a tuk-tuk and away down the duel carriage way holding on to our bags and enjoying the welcome breeze.","The driver takes us to the bus station. No, no, train station!\" we explain. Then we reach the train station. I get"," harassed by a young monk lad, who Claire recognises has learning"," difficulties. The train station doesn't sell tickets until 1pm. We wait."," Then the office opens and we queue fending off the monk as we do. Then I"," realise we only have dollars and this will not work as we need Bhart. I"," get a bloke to take me on the back of his motorbike to an ATM, get the"," cash. Get back and we get our tickets (less than one English pound each) for the 6"," hour train trip to Bangkok.","The journey is great. We sit by the window. The conductor routinely clicks his ticket punch whilst walking down the train. We look out on the unfolding scenery. The vibrant green fields, the sea of white water lotus. Plants crawl over the electric lines. Frighten water buffalo charge away from the roar of the train. We pull the metal shutters down as the rain starts to chucking it down. Although this does not last for long and before we know it we are faffing the shutter backup. Kingfishers sit on the lines and herons float by on the heat in the air. Often people come down the train with wicker baskets full of sugar cane and plastic bags full of brown food stuff. By the time we get to Bangkok it's dark and we need a rest. The train does what seems a great deal of stopping before we get to the main station.","Off we get and the monk from the start of the trip spots me and the hassle starts again. I quickly try and dodge through the walking crowd but he's on my case. Luckily I take a quick corner and I loose him, Although I almost loose Claire. We go to the ticket office and secure a train and boat ride to (Ko Tao) turtle island, but it's not for a couple of days. Another bit of price negotiating with speed racer tuk-tuk driver which costs about as much as our last 6 hour train journey and we are off."," I think the train (which was tourist free) forgot to charge us fraang (foreigner) prices.","The guest house we had our eye on is full but we soon find another and then the rain starts. We don't do much the next few days. Avoid the rain, buy sun glasses (my 4th pair), book to read on the beach (Haruki Murakami's After Dark) and swim ware. It was back to the block where you buy egg Pad Thai fried up in front of your eyes for 25 Bhart (62 Bhart to the English pound). All great selection of faked goods, including Ids: Degrees, TEFAL certificates etc. Also a man on the corner folds pop cans into tuk-tuks for 100 Bhart. Claire also gets fish and chips from the English oh my cod café.","Then it's back to the station and getting in to a Thai train bed. Waking up before the crack of dawn to get a bus and boat to the island. The island is great. Still a bit commercial and definitely has a diver's bent but all the same great. A million places to take your PADI course. We head towards the south east of island where it is quieter and there is good snorkelling. We hire cycles, although the heat and the hills restrict our adventures. It rains, a knock on effect from the Philippines storms and the disaster in Burma, not the rainy season yet.","The next day we go on an organised snorkelling lap of the island. A wonderful day. Sail up to a cover jump in and look at the fishes (Claire saw two sharks) and then climb back on the boat, have a coffee, some fruit, then off to the next place. We stopped off at around five different spots and it was great."," Although it was a little cloudy the bright fish and coral where amazing to explore. We need to get some sort of chart to work out what we saw, but there where parrot fish and gangs of fish of all different verities that seem to go from coral to coral munch stuff up there. You hear them chomping away. I mastered the diving with a snorkel trick.","The problem was the sun though. It didn't feel hot. Yes. I got 1st degree (sun) burns (A Parisian anaesthetist told me in a cool pool bar the day after the day after). So Claire breaks out the natural yoghurt and our local Israeli/south African/English bar manager gives us some fresh aloe Vera. This all gets smeared on my back and I lay still for a very long time. Claire not to be out done fell down some concrete steps in the dark and ripped her knee up a bit.","So the next couple of days I tried not to moan and we concentrate on planning the full moon party coming up. This happens on the 20th on the very commercial main island, so we have decided to get a boat over that will return us at 7am or something daft like that, so I hope it's good...."],

        "description": ["It was the day before and we where running around. Well more like limping around getting supplies  Whiskey, wakey (some sort of energy drink), small sunscreen and insect repellent. Then we jump in the back of a pick up and head to the harbour. It was very apparent which boat was ours, it was the one with the bad music blasting out and excited young people. We brace ourselves and ignore the whispers of regret. From pier across boat we scramble on to the party boat. As we step foot on the boat we are handed a beer. They don't look a bad crowd all lounging around sipping there beers and trying to chat above the thump of the music. The boat fills up and there is a good feeling on the boat, one of the crew tries his best at dancing  and is all smiles as he sips on his own beer.  Then we are off under a beautiful sky as the world twists away from the sun for another day. Drinking continues and there only a handful of over excited people. Only the crew can walk around causally picking up bottles as most people find it hard to walk around with out lurching to grab hold of something or someone to stop there fall as the boat rocks its way towards the next island.","The sky turns dark. It's going to rain. The atmosphere is wonderful and a stark contrast to the brightly coloured party people and then it rains. Chucks it down, everyone heads under the deck roof to stay dry. Everyone apart from an accent-less long haired bearded lad from Manchester. Who just stood there for a while before he decide it as getting too much and joined us. He looked like a good bloke to talk to and as our whisky loosend our social bones we started talking. He had just won 9 Grand using his dad's internet on line poker account. After collage and feeling loney not doing much at home, he got a manual job, but jacked it in after the gambling started to become an income and now he was here, spending his winnings.","We also met a French bloke and his Polish girlfriend. He worked for the oil industry. Most of the time he was isolated in an island above Japan, although I think it was Russian owned. He thought we had reached peek oil, I never doubted Max Kieser.","The boat arrived and we had a few muffled instructions and we where clambering off the boat in the dark over another boat and on to the pier. Then we where hit by a get on the island for full moon party tax. This was in the form of a blue  wrist band which we never put on. Next up was food. We hadn't eaten since breakfast. We found a hectic falafel restaurant and dug in. The table next to us was full of people covering themselves baddly in UV paint and acting randomly.","It was around 9pm. After our fill we headed down the streets which where packed with stalls selling buckets of booze and energy drinks. It had the atmosphere of American spring break rather than any Pagan tropical island secret. Hard sell excess not hedonistic and random, more macho and regulated.","We hit the beach and there is a fair few people up and down, with huge sound systems pumping out bad dance music. A huge flaming skipping rope outside one beach lined super bar. A huge crowd is gathered round as the flames lick around the twirling rope. Drunk youths try to keep up their rhythmic jumps before they get burnt and disappear back into the crowd. To a starch contrast on the beach are the wonderfully graceful Chinese lanterns. These are lit and held until they reach critical mass and wonder off into the night sky and out to sea.","The over consumption continues, quiet hellish as reflected in the glowing horns you can buy but not the glowing round glasses. We head down the beach to the bar at the end for a drink, a sit and most importantly the use of their toilet. The toilet has two Spanish blokes outside singing Johnny Cash and the ubiquitous gecko chirping. We are joined at our table by two English Lads. One works for Lloyd's of London and is blown away by the successes of his sister in the drum and bass scene. The other works in a tower block full of magazines, a stereotype on every floor he tells us and has a sharp mind for films. Good chats, but we can't hang around we want to dissect the messiness on the beach.","People are now cutting out the middle pipe and pissing directly into the sea. Thai police are on the prowl looking for a pay day. I saw them shake one man down but he had nothing they could turn into a bribe so they let him go. We drank and I started random rants with a few other beach dwellers and the night blurred on and out of memory. I remember us dancing ourselves into a hole on the sand and slowly noticing more and more people sleeping on the beach.","The heavy ache of tiredness starts to pull us down. Slowly nonsense conversations with stranger x lose their pace. Then the earth spins around and the sun appears to rise giving a calming change of mood and boost of energy. People wake up on the beach and run around taking photos in the warm light of day break.","Before we know it we are back in the 7-11 getting more booze for the morning boat back.  We wonder back on the boat and everyone is falling asleep. We sit around consider who is the most graceful sleeper and soon get chatting to a young lad from Johannesburg about economics and politics. Claire spots some bloke talking to himself and goes over to assist. I soon join her and he seems OK, but he's not really. His nails are all long as his hair and he wares a Muslim skull cap. He's a Serbian Canadian. Although we have some great conversations, we see him a few days later quickly walking down the street ranting to himself.","We get back to our island and a taxi home with some other very sleepy party goers. 11am and we hit the sack. The next day we hear of Grace's arrival (Bear's friend has just had a baby!) and Mick starts a sober month of recovery."],

I remember on our last day at dusk watching the family which ran our hostel take their radio control boats out on the sea. The children looked on, the parents laughed and the dogs barked at them. A fitting farewell to our beach.","Then we find ourselves sat in an internet café eating and chatting to folk on Skype. The boat was not until 10, then it slipped to 11pm. It was all dark down the harbour with the odd bright light watching heavy machinery. The ship with the JCB unloading gravel turned out to be our cruise liner. The time came, tickets where exchanged and a sailor nimbly balanced both our rucksacks on either side of him and walked along the tight rope like metal alley on the side of the cargo bay and to the cabins at the rear of the ship. He beckoned us to follow and we did with only his smile gleaming in the light. We didn't fall into the black drink we made it to the cabin.","The boat we booked was definitely a working boat with grit and oil and an industrial I framed riveted dark room. That is put aside for a few make shift beds for tourists who had been suckered into being cargo.","Bear and I laughed it off, where as four young English women where feeling a little insecure to be stuck in a grim box with a handful of friendly sailors. We clicked a fan on and the metal heat dissipated. After heavy grinding and shifting of dirt by a JCB, more tourist arrived all wide eyed and confused, then we set sail. Slowly. After a blurry read we fall asleep. Unfortunately I was next to Bruce lee who kicked me through out the night.","The dawn came and so did the shore. Back on dry land we where loaded into a mini bus not unlike the one we had in NZ. Some people where bound for Bangkok and some for Hat Yai. Both in different directions. Sometimes its best to sit tight.","Before we knew it we where sat with a bloke from Bradford eating breakfast and waiting for our connection bus to Hat Yai. Post Human Geography degree and crappy factory jobs he was now a traveller. He had many a tail of drinking and ending back at his hostel early in the morning. He told of loosing flip flops and stealing others. He had friends all over the world he was visiting. He taken favours from them all. He paid no rent to his folks and he used to like indie rock  Kings of Leon, White Stripes, Libertines  etc. etc., but now a days he was out of touch. He said he found it hard to go home and it took him a while to stop living out of a rucksack when he got back.","Then we were off to another place, a bus station and our bus turned up and we where off. Although there seemed to be no tourists on the bus, when we got off five hours later the tuk-tuk touts where at our throats. We decide to all jump in one and head towards our chosen hostel near the train station.","This place is horrid, full of porn DVD for sale on the street and just like a rebuilt bombed city. It was a high rise border town with a lot of dark corners. Our room was basic at best, we got a film and watched it. Howard, the man from Bradford was off to the west cost of Malaysia we parted as we where heading east.","Now British Rail is criminally bad and it just shows when we get our ticket to head towards the border further south, the Sungai Kolok crossing. It cost just over an English pound for this four hour journey! Once again don't take the tourist touted buses at around 500% more, stick with the locals it's better for so many different reasons. But first the problem is breakfast, which Bear finds in the shape of fruit. Ananas and Mango.","The train pulls up and seems fairly full, although it seems a lot of people are getting off. They are getting off with their wears, which consist of huge plastic bags full of chilli's and other foods, as well as hand bags and other sell-able's.","","So we board the train and sit in a carriage that has green seats opposite each other like a wide tube train. There is no plastic on this train though, it is all chrome and painted brown wood. There are some small posters advertising chilli hot sauce. A series of fans on the ceiling that gather cob webs, although the carriage is not hot.","Not another backpacker in sight. A man with a large M16 machine gun gets on and walks slowly down the centre of the carriage, we just munch our fruit. The carriage is full of a cross section of ages. Old men staring wistfully out of the window, kids playing with their mobiles and an old women push coal or it that shit down the carriage in a basket. She smiles at Bear and often shakes her hand and cackles.","The ticket punchers soon come down, clicking their punches. One growls at the old women as she is putting the coal stuff out on paper at the end of the carriage. She just smacks him around the ankles and growls back.","Outside the window the sky has a few fair weather clouds and the countryside is lush and alive with butterflies. We pass the odd red dust road and every station has sandbags and heavy army machinery from an almost forgotten disagreement with Malaysia. Also as we get closer to the border, in fact I think Yala is the the point where change becomes obvious, everything is going slightly Muslim. More and more hooded women and men in skull caps with long skirts. Although I do spot one kid who has misfit slip on shoes.","The carriage fills up, people are now standing in every space. Hunger catches up and we stop one of the hawkers who work their way up and down tapping there rings on a tray full of different foods. 20 Bhart later and we have our teeth in a boiled corn on the cob each. Yum. We don't follow the tradition of throwing plastic rubbish out the window and sit tight until we arrive.","We get to the last stop and pile off the train on the track, a quick toilet stop as the sky gets angry. After asking a few soldiers on the station where the border is we head across the track towards where we think the border might be. Then it rains, full on tropical storm rains. Dripping we make it to the Thailand exit stamp border and then on to Malaysia. Everyone else seems to be in vehicles and we just splash by the side of the road to the walkers entrance. We are alone and it seems closed as first but it isn't and we pass into the country.","The rain is still hammering down. Then we are approached by a taxi driver offering a lift to the bay where we can get a boat to the islands. This obviously is a well travelled route and he guesses right first time where we want to go. We are too wet to bother about haggling and just ask him to take us to an ATM so we can get some local money. He then picks up a yank and a Canadian and the price drops.","The yank has scabs all over his face and both of them seem very well travelled in party destinations around the world. The yank complains about Muslim countries and we drive on.","I don't know if it's the paxo theory or the fact that the driver wants to get to town to pray, but he drives like an extreme mumbia nutter. The paxo theory being that when Paxo was straight edge (no drink etc, not unlike Muslims) he used to drive in an extreme crazy fashion.","We get there a bit stiff, sleepy and hungry. We are sold a boat trip for the morrow and we check into a crap hotel. There is an arrow on the ceiling of the room, I wonder if this is Mecca's direction, as we see on the next few rooms we stay in. The bathroom door cannot open more than a ¼ due to the sink and the whole town has the charm of a truckers stop. The plugs are UK plugs though. We have some crap food from a place on the corner and hit the sack.","The next day we are ushered down the road with some Chinese girls towards a jetty full of tourists. Chaos. We sling our bags on a small 12 seater speed boat and we are away, wind in our hair and smiles on our faces. The sun bounces off the sea. The head of the boat bobs up and down as we cut through the water. Dropping off people as we go, we are amazed how clear the water is and how much life we can see below.","We get to long beach on the small island and have to get another water taxi to the shore. After wondering around the beach for a bit, we find accommodation that is not like a tenko corrugated iron heat trap. Although as we find out after the next few days it is a heat trap and has a loud generator that kicks in from 6:30pm to 9am, which is the only time you can use the very necessary fan.","This place is alive. Little grass hoppers dance around the grass as you walk and often you come across timid huge monitor lizards. There are also eagle type birds on the beach and circling above. The jungle surrounds the beach and there is a little 10 minute track through it to a beach on the other cost. It's hot!","Most of the beach stalls do not sell booze, although there are two raga bars that do. We spend the next few days in a bit of a heat blur, until we find some much better accommodation with 24 electricity on the other quieter coral beach. Also you can snorkel and see fishes on this beach. We do have our first Malay food in the shape of a curry. It is great, although we had to have a harvest of flavoursome pods and sticks hidden in the food before you could spoon it down. Also they do a great chocolate milk shake, almost everywhere on the island. The chocolate ice cream towered over the glass, so to stop a tsunami of melted shake I spooned it down fast. this caused an ice cream headache of extreme short lived pain. Karl reckons he's immune to this and has never experienced this pain, not that I would wish this on anyone, a cruel side of me would like him put to the test on this misfortune."],

        "description": ["We quickly adjust to the wonderful new room with its constant fan, hot water,flushing toilet all mixed together with contented sighing of a sea view. This bay also allows you to swim and snorkel without the constant worry of being decapitated by one of the local speed boats. So we happily head into the water on the first day and find an array of multi coloured fish nibbling the mushroom shaped coral around us but ouach, eeec tiny little electric shocks like itching powder all over your body. I was a tad freaked out, we later find the little critters are Sea Lice. Microscopic nipping creatures. We book a snorkeling tour for the next day anyhow.","Eight people are loaded into a tiny boat but all equipped and Mick's delicate skin covered by a T shirt we head to Shark Bay. The guide tells us to follow him and soon he is shouting shark shark we swim after him as quick as our little flippers would carry us and there it is a Black Tipped Reef"," Shark circling below us. They are roughly a meter and a half long and look very well fed (luckily). The next stop is a long stretch of turquoise water in search of Giant Turtles. We spot five in all. They are the most beautiful graceful creatures I have ever encountered, they seem to exudes an air of wisdom and knowing. We hover over taking in the scene and then it starts to rise from the sea bed to take in a gulp of air. It swims about a meter in front of us and we glide along with it. The approximate size of the largest turtle was about over a meter long and about a meter wide. We get so close that we see the dual cleaner fish living underneath the turtles tummy. I'm glad he has some company as they seem such lonely creatures. Amazing experience. On to Coral Garden as we jump into the water we are already surrounded by hundreds of fish of all colours shapes and sizes.","Then on to romantic beach where the sun was streaming through the jack-in-a-box clouds, this in turn made tunnels of light underwater. We get to see a small sting ray, more nemo fish hiding in the sea anemone and smogs of collective thinking little fish. Even a baby octopus and pikey fish swimming near the surface. As the day dies the sea come alive and every so often a whole school of fish arc out of the water.","After we get back on dry land we shower and go for dinner. The sun has set and we are sat at the beach fish BBQ restaurant with the NYC waiter. The light house winks at us from across the bay as we fill up on Malay delights."," Then its back to the cabin to watch the bats bombing through our porch, as well as - heady and headaleena, two geckos on our door.","The next two days are spent snorkelling independently from the beach. We realise the later it gets the more the wildlife comes out to play. At sunset I spot a large black reef shark swimming toward me in the shallows but he soon spots me and shoots off. On our last day we go in search of turtles and we aren't disappointed as Mick and I have an exclusive meeting with Mr Turtle. A wonderful gift for our final day.",">Pictures are stolen from internet land, but we saw these and more","(as usual click on the picture to make them bigger)"],

        "description": ["We woke in the highest cabin, the noisy French family had gone and we where soon to follow their led. We crowbarred ourselves out of bed and looked out through the trees past the twirling squirrels and down on to the bay for the last time.","Soon we where plodding along the jetty with our bags. The third boat was ours and off we went after almost falling in the drink and standing on tutting muslin mother's feet. Back on the main land we waited for our mini bus to the highlands. We met an young Irish couple  George and Teresa. One studying disease, the other to study civil engineering. It's funny it's due to them that I'm typing this in this gloomy room in Kuala Lumpur.","We pile on to the mini bus and we are away. Later I find myself trying to tell a Malaysian man all that I knew about Guernsey whilst waiting for a toilet in the change over stop. His brother in law lives there and all I could say was potatoes.","The next bus was a taxi Cameron highland bound, well Tanah Rata bound, well fathers guest house bound, well Cameron Secrets really. You see an English priest used to own this, 1920's build hostel, but he past away last year and now it might be called Cameron Secrets.","Anyway after passing 10's of logging trucks carrying very old trees, through NZ type landscape, watching the drivers son's head jerk back up from sleep a hundred times and the looping tape attacking our ears with Malay iron maiden and rock ballads, we arrive. The weather is cool at 1300 to 1829 meters above the sea. This is the place of the (never over) land rover, there are thousands of them here in various states of repair. It's weirdly English, in a story book sense. Convent on the hill, cream teas, even a farther and son playing badminton. Chinese, Indian and Malay descent people. Great food and rainy weather. The hostel is like a rehab centre for sun burnt travellers.","Strawberries , strawberries, strawberries every bloody where. It seems that the British as well as giving the locals the lovely lovely tea they also left there love of tat You cant buy anything here without a strawberry on it and all the cars strawberry have seat covers etc. Having resisted the urge to buy a strawberry umbrella, socks and bag we decide to do a jungle walk and visit the tea plantation.","About 14 people get crushed into the back of a land rover with an overexcited although very knowledgeable tour guide. We snake our way through the rolling mountains to a breathtaking view of the ocean of tea in front of me. All that lovely beautiful tea, I felt all guide and warm inside. YUM but for now not a drop to drink.","The guide tells us lots of fascinating tea facts like that black, white and green tea are all from the same bush. Crammed back into the Land rover we head off until the Land rovers battery dies so the walk is longer than expected. The whole jungle is covered in moss, the key to the local eco system. The guide points out plants with medicinal purposes such as citronella leaf, A plant to reduce pain from leach bites and another that reduces cholesterol. Finally we get to the Tea plantation where we get a whirlwind tour and yes yes finally a beautiful, wonderful large mug of tea. Bliss.","We get dropped off at the Butterfly Farm which was a bit run down and grim to say the least. You see there was a load of cattle farms here, but they contracted a disease, so they got killed and replaced with cactus, butterfly, roses, honey farms."," The capturers all cooped up in there all looked"," a tad sad but we couldn't help but take"," a few picks of the happier looking critters. With no local bus or taxi in sight we start to hike back in the rain. An hour and"," a half later with no sign of the guest house we give in when we finally spot a taxi. Good job as well as that's when the hills started.","The next day we toddle off to Robinson Fall, as my sir name is Robinson I feel the ancestral pull to go and visit, however this Robinson did fall down a huge bloody drain on the way. That night we went to the centre to see a Chinese parade. It was an hour late and then it really really rained. It was very underwhelming seeing a load of soggy floats and blokes weaving a fireless dragon in plastic bag up and down in the rain.","One more night at Fathers and we find a moth nearly as big as my hand in the corridor, then we were up bright and early to catch out super VIP bus to Kuala Lumper.","- (as usual click on the picture to make them bigger) -"],

        "description": ["The last blog was posted on the blog's birthday, at writing this we have less than two weeks before our flight tickets run out and we find ourselves scratching our heads in Nottingham. Anyhow, by the time we reach Kuala Lumper the temperature has already risen back to its usual sweat. We get dropped off in the middle of the city after a bit of a taxi faff we get to our recommended hostel in the golden triangle. It's a bit gloomy but we soon find out it's quiet cheap and roomy compared to the others around.","The next couple of days consist of sight seeing and running around the hectic China town. As well as eating curry climbing the Menara tower to look at the Petronas towers (2nd biggest sky scraper in the world) and visiting the Islamic museum - an amazing building with an Islamic women are not oppressed honestly exhibition. All good, all hot, then we flew.","We land at KK in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We check in to the hotel Simon has booked for us and go out for food. After a quick call to Simon we go to Upperstar bar. Simon pulls up on his bike and we chat the night away.","We laze the next few days away until we are driving to the"," Nature Lodge at Kinabatangan with Simon, Ed and Naz. They are heading to a bat cave to rig up some platforms for some BBC filming. Bear and I are heading for leach central. The drive takes about six hours and the landscape on the way in incredable.We have a couple of beers with Simon and share a few nottingham and Jungle tails. Apprehensively we retire to our hut a little concerned about the creatures that might be keeping us company in the dark. But only"," a frog joins us.","Soon it was get your wellies on we are going for a tramp in the jungle. First check your socks are over your trousers and off we march and your clothes are tucked in (anti leech stylee). The wellies come in handy as the mud often reaches the top of them or in Claire case knee height.. We do get to witness the man of the jungle hanging hairy in the trees , an adult male complete with his plate face. We feel fairly good about this as it's quiet rare to see an orangutan in the wild. We make our way to the fish full oxbow lake.","This is all done with short stops in between to check for leaches. We all fall fowl of them, although we get them off before they start drinking. They tend to hang around the edges of leafs trying to smell out your warmth (see film). After they get on you, they sort of climb to any crevasse on your body that is warm. If you catch them climbing you can just flick them off, otherwise a spray of bug repellent will make them curl up and then you just flick them off. They will drink for around 20 minutes and drop off leaving you to bleed everywhere but not in any danger. Quiet horrid really, but after the initial fear it's easier to cope with.","However when we get back to our hut we find one under bear's arm pit that has been having a good sup. We get rid of him but the blood flows. The sweetly singing women at the lodge help out patching the hole up and put tobacco on the wound, which we are very dubious of. That night we get to see a water leach in a bottle which are more the big black slug like thing that I expected. Yuk. We get a great talk by Papa bear (the owner of the lodge). We learn about the wild life, locals, logging, palm oil as we down a beer or two.","Next was a night river cruise where saw more orangutans, black squirrels and proboscis monkeys. Lack of big lens on the camera left us with few photos.","After a kip it's back on the boat and bus heading to Sepilok. We spend two nights there. It has a world class rainforest discovery centre that has canopy walks and more information than we can remember  they should really publish a book. Also we go to the orangutan rehab centre, where we watch a orangutan feed and the cheeky monkeys eat the scraps. Before we know it Simon has picked us up again and we are KK bound eating snake skinned fruit with Ed and Naz. Back past the palm trees stretching out as far as the eye can see where once stood a rainforest.","Our exit is all a bit of a rush. We get to meet Simon's wife Christine and two week old son Ewan, Louise was still at nursery again. Before bombing off to the airport.","We see more of Sabah by the air. The turquoise lined island disappear as does the mountain that is cut in two by a line of cloud. We see the sky darken and the orange full moon turns white as we cross the equator Bali bound. It"," looked like we were going to fall into the sea, like a bright eyes song, but we just sneak on to the tight run way to the city of ageing surfers carving out the left handers.","The Borneo experience was all to brief but thanks to Simon we were able to make the most of it. Cheers to the Amos clan.","- (as usual click on the picture to make them bigger) -","- Also connection too slow for films (they will have to wait -"],

We saw traditional dancing and eat a great meal on the solstice. Bear did help some Java school girls with their English lessons. This was in the shade of trees on the beach where some good surfing was happening. We didn't get knocked over by some surf board carrying moped Aussie. We"," did leave for Ubud. But first a quick motorcycle ride with luggage through the back streets to a road that would take a bus.","An hour or so later and we where at the small bus station. After getting our orientation we headed for monkey forest road. Heavy bags and hot sun didn't break a great first impression.","A tout promising swimming pool hostel leads us to ?Sagittarius Inn and Bungalows, just off monkey forest road and wow. A small army where brushing the lawn clean. A truly great place. The restaurant associated with the hotel is of a similar quality. In this fine establishment Bear tastes the best spring rolls of her life.","Although the paths of this town are drainage covers that go up and down, the shops and massage parlours make for a good browse. Although saying no to touts is wearing.","We spend a day in the monkey forest where tourist are climbed on by monkeys and men prepare structures for the cremation ceremony.","We enrol on a cookery course that takes us to the colourful food market in the morning and to the peaceful rice paddies for outside cooking with Nanny and her daughter. By mid day we've cooked and eaten more than our fill, with a glass of wine we contently fall asleep in the hostel.","Ubud holds us. We go to near by markets and just drift through the days jumping in the pool when it gets too hot."," Tonight is more traditional chanting and tomorrow we prepare for Hong Hong.","- (as usual click on the picture to make them bigger) -"],

Any hows we get the bus out of town and on to Hong Kong. It's big, dotted with water, green hills and sky scrapes, shipping containers and shops and shop and more shops. We play hotel shuffle, eat local noodles and have a pint at Stanley. Stanley has a beach and a market and a sea front surrounded by lush green hills. It's a tube and a bus away from where we are staying but it's easy enough to get to. At night we watch the sky scrapers do their nightly light show.","Then we wake and head to the huge airport. After we check in we have to get a tube train to our gate. Soon I'm drinking wine on the 12 hour trip back to London. We arrive before we leave and the dirty dysfunction of London airport tube transport throws us towards Victoria bus station for a pint and a lift back to Nottingham. Midnight we get to Cherry trees and a wonderful warm welcome. The next night we are down the peacock to a lovely friendly gathering wondering what has happened. We feel like we have been rolled around in waves thrown into a time washing machine and spat out the other side... AAAARRRRRR SSSPPPLLLAAAT.","We hope Nottingham will be kind..... Ultimately I'm sure it wont. There is so much more I want to se e. Norwegian frozen waterfalls, Romanian and Canadian bears, St Petersburg, hot hungry springs, Canadian Rockies, Californian red woods, Tibet, Darjeeling, Central America, African and Mongolian planes. Brazil. North Scotland, the forest of dean, Hadrian's wall, the Pennine way. Ireland. The list goes on. In these times it looks like you will need an ever expanding bag of time and money to do this. The grey skies here don't effect how good it feels to see friends and family. We have a fist full of weddings to go to and whole bunch of new babies to meet. So maybe we can trick ourselves away from the rabbit in the head light feelings. Trying not to thinks of houses, income, form fillings, moving stuff around, phone calls etc etc until Monday. Erm, I wonder how much the flights are to France....","- (as usual click on the picture to make them bigger) -","","-(some old films... more to come... maybe)-"],
